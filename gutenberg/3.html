<p><a name="chap01"></a></p> <h2>WALDEN</h2>

<p><a name="chap02"></a></p> <h2>Economy</h2>

<p>
When I wrote the following pages, or rather the bulk of them, I lived alone, in
the woods, a mile from any neighbor, in a house which I had built myself, on
the shore of Walden Pond, in Concord, Massachusetts, and earned my living by
the labor of my hands only. I lived there two years and two months. At present
I am a sojourner in civilized life again.
</p>

<p>
I should not obtrude my affairs so much on the notice of my readers if very
particular inquiries had not been made by my townsmen concerning my mode of
life, which some would call impertinent, though they do not appear to me at all
impertinent, but, considering the circumstances, very natural and pertinent.
Some have asked what I got to eat; if I did not feel lonesome; if I was not
afraid; and the like. Others have been curious to learn what portion of my
income I devoted to charitable purposes; and some, who have large families, how
many poor children I maintained. I will therefore ask those of my readers who
feel no particular interest in me to pardon me if I undertake to answer some of
these questions in this book. In most books, the <i>I</i>, or first person, is
omitted; in this it will be retained; that, in respect to egotism, is the main
difference. We commonly do not remember that it is, after all, always the first
person that is speaking. I should not talk so much about myself if there were
anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by
the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every
writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not
merely what he has heard of other men&rsquo;s lives; some such account as he
would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely,
it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more
particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they
will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the
seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.
</p>

<p>
I would fain say something, not so much concerning the Chinese and Sandwich
Islanders as you who read these pages, who are said to live in New England;
something about your condition, especially your outward condition or
circumstances in this world, in this town, what it is, whether it is necessary
that it be as bad as it is, whether it cannot be improved as well as not. I
have travelled a good deal in Concord; and everywhere, in shops, and offices,
and fields, the inhabitants have appeared to me to be doing penance in a
thousand remarkable ways. What I have heard of Brahmins sitting exposed to four
fires and looking in the face of the sun; or hanging suspended, with their
heads downward, over flames; or looking at the heavens over their shoulders
&ldquo;until it becomes impossible for them to resume their natural position,
while from the twist of the neck nothing but liquids can pass into the
stomach;&rdquo; or dwelling, chained for life, at the foot of a tree; or
measuring with their bodies, like caterpillars, the breadth of vast empires; or
standing on one leg on the tops of pillars,&mdash;even these forms of conscious
penance are hardly more incredible and astonishing than the scenes which I
daily witness. The twelve labors of Hercules were trifling in comparison with
those which my neighbors have undertaken; for they were only twelve, and had an
end; but I could never see that these men slew or captured any monster or
finished any labor. They have no friend Iolas to burn with a hot iron the root
of the hydra&rsquo;s head, but as soon as one head is crushed, two spring up.
</p>

<p>
I see young men, my townsmen, whose misfortune it is to have inherited farms,
houses, barns, cattle, and farming tools; for these are more easily acquired
than got rid of. Better if they had been born in the open pasture and suckled
by a wolf, that they might have seen with clearer eyes what field they were
called to labor in. Who made them serfs of the soil? Why should they eat their
sixty acres, when man is condemned to eat only his peck of dirt? Why should
they begin digging their graves as soon as they are born? They have got to live
a man&rsquo;s life, pushing all these things before them, and get on as well as
they can. How many a poor immortal soul have I met well nigh crushed and
smothered under its load, creeping down the road of life, pushing before it a
barn seventy-five feet by forty, its Augean stables never cleansed, and one
hundred acres of land, tillage, mowing, pasture, and wood-lot! The portionless,
who struggle with no such unnecessary inherited encumbrances, find it labor
enough to subdue and cultivate a few cubic feet of flesh.
</p>

<p>
But men labor under a mistake. The better part of the man is soon plowed into
the soil for compost. By a seeming fate, commonly called necessity, they are
employed, as it says in an old book, laying up treasures which moth and rust
will corrupt and thieves break through and steal. It is a fool&rsquo;s life, as
they will find when they get to the end of it, if not before. It is said that
Deucalion and Pyrrha created men by throwing stones over their heads behind
them:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
Inde genus durum sumus, experiensque laborum,<br />
Et documenta damus qu√¢ simus origine nati.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Or, as Raleigh rhymes it in his sonorous way,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;From thence our kind hard-hearted is, enduring pain and care,<br />
Approving that our bodies of a stony nature are.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
So much for a blind obedience to a blundering oracle, throwing the stones over
their heads behind them, and not seeing where they fell.
</p>

<p>
Most men, even in this comparatively free country, through mere ignorance and
mistake, are so occupied with the factitious cares and superfluously coarse
labors of life that its finer fruits cannot be plucked by them. Their fingers,
from excessive toil, are too clumsy and tremble too much for that. Actually,
the laboring man has not leisure for a true integrity day by day; he cannot
afford to sustain the manliest relations to men; his labor would be depreciated
in the market. He has no time to be anything but a machine. How can he remember
well his ignorance&mdash;which his growth requires&mdash;who has so often to
use his knowledge? We should feed and clothe him gratuitously sometimes, and
recruit him with our cordials, before we judge of him. The finest qualities of
our nature, like the bloom on fruits, can be preserved only by the most
delicate handling. Yet we do not treat ourselves nor one another thus tenderly.
</p>

<p>
Some of you, we all know, are poor, find it hard to live, are sometimes, as it
were, gasping for breath. I have no doubt that some of you who read this book
are unable to pay for all the dinners which you have actually eaten, or for the
coats and shoes which are fast wearing or are already worn out, and have come
to this page to spend borrowed or stolen time, robbing your creditors of an
hour. It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my
sight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into
business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the
Latins <i>√¶s alienum</i>, another&rsquo;s brass, for some of their coins were
made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other&rsquo;s brass;
always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today,
insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not
state-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a
nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous
generosity, that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or
his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making
yourselves sick, that you may lay up something against a sick day, something to
be tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or,
more safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how
little.
</p>

<p>
I sometimes wonder that we can be so frivolous, I may almost say, as to attend
to the gross but somewhat foreign form of servitude called Negro Slavery, there
are so many keen and subtle masters that enslave both north and south. It is
hard to have a southern overseer; it is worse to have a northern one; but worst
of all when you are the slave-driver of yourself. Talk of a divinity in man!
Look at the teamster on the highway, wending to market by day or night; does
any divinity stir within him? His highest duty to fodder and water his horses!
What is his destiny to him compared with the shipping interests? Does not he
drive for Squire Make-a-stir? How godlike, how immortal, is he? See how he
cowers and sneaks, how vaguely all the day he fears, not being immortal nor
divine, but the slave and prisoner of his own opinion of himself, a fame won by
his own deeds. Public opinion is a weak tyrant compared with our own private
opinion. What a man thinks of himself, that it is which determines, or rather
indicates, his fate. Self-emancipation even in the West Indian provinces of the
fancy and imagination,&mdash;what Wilberforce is there to bring that about?
Think, also, of the ladies of the land weaving toilet cushions against the last
day, not to betray too green an interest in their fates! As if you could kill
time without injuring eternity.
</p>

<p>
The mass of men lead lives of quiet desperation. What is called resignation is
confirmed desperation. From the desperate city you go into the desperate
country, and have to console yourself with the bravery of minks and muskrats. A
stereotyped but unconscious despair is concealed even under what are called the
games and amusements of mankind. There is no play in them, for this comes after
work. But it is a characteristic of wisdom not to do desperate things.
</p>

<p>
When we consider what, to use the words of the catechism, is the chief end of
man, and what are the true necessaries and means of life, it appears as if men
had deliberately chosen the common mode of living because they preferred it to
any other. Yet they honestly think there is no choice left. But alert and
healthy natures remember that the sun rose clear. It is never too late to give
up our prejudices. No way of thinking or doing, however ancient, can be trusted
without proof. What everybody echoes or in silence passes by as true to-day may
turn out to be falsehood to-morrow, mere smoke of opinion, which some had
trusted for a cloud that would sprinkle fertilizing rain on their fields. What
old people say you cannot do you try and find that you can. Old deeds for old
people, and new deeds for new. Old people did not know enough once, perchance,
to fetch fresh fuel to keep the fire a-going; new people put a little dry wood
under a pot, and are whirled round the globe with the speed of birds, in a way
to kill old people, as the phrase is. Age is no better, hardly so well,
qualified for an instructor as youth, for it has not profited so much as it has
lost. One may almost doubt if the wisest man has learned any thing of absolute
value by living. Practically, the old have no very important advice to give the
young, their own experience has been so partial, and their lives have been such
miserable failures, for private reasons, as they must believe; and it may be
that they have some faith left which belies that experience, and they are only
less young than they were. I have lived some thirty years on this planet, and I
have yet to hear the first syllable of valuable or even earnest advice from my
seniors. They have told me nothing, and probably cannot tell me any thing to the
purpose. Here is life, an experiment to a great extent untried by me; but it
does not avail me that they have tried it. If I have any experience which I
think valuable, I am sure to reflect that this my Mentors said nothing about.
</p>

<p>
One farmer says to me, &ldquo;You cannot live on vegetable food solely, for it
furnishes nothing to make bones with;&rdquo; and so he religiously devotes a
part of his day to supplying his system with the raw material of bones; walking
all the while he talks behind his oxen, which, with vegetable-made bones, jerk
him and his lumbering plough along in spite of every obstacle. Some things are
really necessaries of life in some circles, the most helpless and diseased,
which in others are luxuries merely, and in others still are entirely unknown.
</p>

<p>
The whole ground of human life seems to some to have been gone over by their
predecessors, both the heights and the valleys, and all things to have been
cared for. According to Evelyn, &ldquo;the wise Solomon prescribed ordinances
for the very distances of trees; and the Roman pr√¶tors have decided how
often you may go into your neighbor&rsquo;s land to gather the acorns which
fall on it without trespass, and what share belongs to that neighbor.&rdquo;
Hippocrates has even left directions how we should cut our nails; that is, even
with the ends of the fingers, neither shorter nor longer. Undoubtedly the very
tedium and ennui which presume to have exhausted the variety and the joys of
life are as old as Adam. But man&rsquo;s capacities have never been measured;
nor are we to judge of what he can do by any precedents, so little has been
tried. Whatever have been thy failures hitherto, &ldquo;be not afflicted, my
child, for who shall assign to thee what thou hast left undone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We might try our lives by a thousand simple tests; as, for instance, that the
same sun which ripens my beans illumines at once a system of earths like ours.
If I had remembered this it would have prevented some mistakes. This was not
the light in which I hoed them. The stars are the apexes of what wonderful
triangles! What distant and different beings in the various mansions of the
universe are contemplating the same one at the same moment! Nature and human
life are as various as our several constitutions. Who shall say what prospect
life offers to another? Could a greater miracle take place than for us to look
through each other&rsquo;s eyes for an instant? We should live in all the ages
of the world in an hour; ay, in all the worlds of the ages. History, Poetry,
Mythology!&mdash;I know of no reading of another&rsquo;s experience so
startling and informing as this would be.
</p>

<p>
The greater part of what my neighbors call good I believe in my soul to be bad,
and if I repent of anything, it is very likely to be my good behavior. What
demon possessed me that I behaved so well? You may say the wisest thing you
can, old man,&mdash;you who have lived seventy years, not without honor of a
kind,&mdash;I hear an irresistible voice which invites me away from all that.
One generation abandons the enterprises of another like stranded vessels.
</p>

<p>
I think that we may safely trust a good deal more than we do. We may waive just
so much care of ourselves as we honestly bestow elsewhere. Nature is as well
adapted to our weakness as to our strength. The incessant anxiety and strain of
some is a well nigh incurable form of disease. We are made to exaggerate the
importance of what work we do; and yet how much is not done by us! or, what if
we had been taken sick? How vigilant we are! determined not to live by faith if
we can avoid it; all the day long on the alert, at night we unwillingly say our
prayers and commit ourselves to uncertainties. So thoroughly and sincerely are
we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of
change. This is the only way, we say; but there are as many ways as there can
be drawn radii from one centre. All change is a miracle to contemplate; but it
is a miracle which is taking place every instant. Confucius said, &ldquo;To
know that we know what we know, and that we do not know what we do not know,
that is true knowledge.&rdquo; When one man has reduced a fact of the
imagination to be a fact to his understanding, I foresee that all men at length
establish their lives on that basis.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
Let us consider for a moment what most of the trouble and anxiety which I have
referred to is about, and how much it is necessary that we be troubled, or, at
least, careful. It would be some advantage to live a primitive and frontier
life, though in the midst of an outward civilization, if only to learn what are
the gross necessaries of life and what methods have been taken to obtain them;
or even to look over the old day-books of the merchants, to see what it was
that men most commonly bought at the stores, what they stored, that is, what
are the grossest groceries. For the improvements of ages have had but little
influence on the essential laws of man&rsquo;s existence; as our skeletons,
probably, are not to be distinguished from those of our ancestors.
</p>

<p>
By the words, <i>necessary of life</i>, I mean whatever, of all that man
obtains by his own exertions, has been from the first, or from long use has
become, so important to human life that few, if any, whether from savageness,
or poverty, or philosophy, ever attempt to do without it. To many creatures
there is in this sense but one necessary of life, Food. To the bison of the
prairie it is a few inches of palatable grass, with water to drink; unless he
seeks the Shelter of the forest or the mountain&rsquo;s shadow. None of the
brute creation requires more than Food and Shelter. The necessaries of life for
man in this climate may, accurately enough, be distributed under the several
heads of Food, Shelter, Clothing, and Fuel; for not till we have secured these
are we prepared to entertain the true problems of life with freedom and a
prospect of success. Man has invented, not only houses, but clothes and cooked
food; and possibly from the accidental discovery of the warmth of fire, and the
consequent use of it, at first a luxury, arose the present necessity to sit by
it. We observe cats and dogs acquiring the same second nature. By proper
Shelter and Clothing we legitimately retain our own internal heat; but with an
excess of these, or of Fuel, that is, with an external heat greater than our
own internal, may not cookery properly be said to begin? Darwin, the
naturalist, says of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego, that while his own
party, who were well clothed and sitting close to a fire, were far from too
warm, these naked savages, who were farther off, were observed, to his great
surprise, &ldquo;to be streaming with perspiration at undergoing such a
roasting.&rdquo; So, we are told, the New Hollander goes naked with impunity,
while the European shivers in his clothes. Is it impossible to combine the
hardiness of these savages with the intellectualness of the civilized man?
According to Liebig, man&rsquo;s body is a stove, and food the fuel which keeps
up the internal combustion in the lungs. In cold weather we eat more, in warm
less. The animal heat is the result of a slow combustion, and disease and death
take place when this is too rapid; or for want of fuel, or from some defect in
the draught, the fire goes out. Of course the vital heat is not to be
confounded with fire; but so much for analogy. It appears, therefore, from the
above list, that the expression, <i>animal life</i>, is nearly synonymous with
the expression, <i>animal heat</i>; for while Food may be regarded as the Fuel
which keeps up the fire within us,&mdash;and Fuel serves only to prepare that
Food or to increase the warmth of our bodies by addition from
without,&mdash;Shelter and Clothing also serve only to retain the <i>heat</i>
thus generated and absorbed.
</p>

<p>
The grand necessity, then, for our bodies, is to keep warm, to keep the vital
heat in us. What pains we accordingly take, not only with our Food, and
Clothing, and Shelter, but with our beds, which are our night-clothes, robbing
the nests and breasts of birds to prepare this shelter within a shelter, as the
mole has its bed of grass and leaves at the end of its burrow! The poor man is
wont to complain that this is a cold world; and to cold, no less physical than
social, we refer directly a great part of our ails. The summer, in some
climates, makes possible to man a sort of Elysian life. Fuel, except to cook
his Food, is then unnecessary; the sun is his fire, and many of the fruits are
sufficiently cooked by its rays; while Food generally is more various, and more
easily obtained, and Clothing and Shelter are wholly or half unnecessary. At
the present day, and in this country, as I find by my own experience, a few
implements, a knife, an axe, a spade, a wheelbarrow, &amp;c., and for the
studious, lamplight, stationery, and access to a few books, rank next to
necessaries, and can all be obtained at a trifling cost. Yet some, not wise, go
to the other side of the globe, to barbarous and unhealthy regions, and devote
themselves to trade for ten or twenty years, in order that they may
live,&mdash;that is, keep comfortably warm,&mdash;and die in New England at last.
The luxuriously rich are not simply kept comfortably warm, but unnaturally hot;
as I implied before, they are cooked, of course <i>√† la mode</i>.
</p>

<p>
Most of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only
not indispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of mankind. With
respect to luxuries and comforts, the wisest have ever lived a more simple and
meagre life than the poor. The ancient philosophers, Chinese, Hindoo, Persian,
and Greek, were a class than which none has been poorer in outward riches, none
so rich in inward. We know not much about them. It is remarkable that <i>we</i>
know so much of them as we do. The same is true of the more modern reformers
and benefactors of their race. None can be an impartial or wise observer of
human life but from the vantage ground of what we should call voluntary
poverty. Of a life of luxury the fruit is luxury, whether in agriculture, or
commerce, or literature, or art. There are nowadays professors of philosophy,
but not philosophers. Yet it is admirable to profess because it was once
admirable to live. To be a philosopher is not merely to have subtle thoughts,
nor even to found a school, but so to love wisdom as to live according to its
dictates, a life of simplicity, independence, magnanimity, and trust. It is to
solve some of the problems of life, not only theoretically, but practically.
The success of great scholars and thinkers is commonly a courtier-like success,
not kingly, not manly. They make shift to live merely by conformity,
practically as their fathers did, and are in no sense the progenitors of a
nobler race of men. But why do men degenerate ever? What makes families run out?
What is the nature of the luxury which enervates and destroys nations? Are we
sure that there is none of it in our own lives? The philosopher is in advance
of his age even in the outward form of his life. He is not fed, sheltered,
clothed, warmed, like his contemporaries. How can a man be a philosopher and
not maintain his vital heat by better methods than other men?
</p>

<p>
When a man is warmed by the several modes which I have described, what does he
want next? Surely not more warmth of the same kind, as more and richer food,
larger and more splendid houses, finer and more abundant clothing, more
numerous incessant and hotter fires, and the like. When he has obtained those
things which are necessary to life, there is another alternative than to obtain
the superfluities; and that is, to adventure on life now, his vacation from
humbler toil having commenced. The soil, it appears, is suited to the seed, for
it has sent its radicle downward, and it may now send its shoot upward also
with confidence. Why has man rooted himself thus firmly in the earth, but that
he may rise in the same proportion into the heavens above?&mdash;for the nobler
plants are valued for the fruit they bear at last in the air and light, far
from the ground, and are not treated like the humbler esculents, which, though
they may be biennials, are cultivated only till they have perfected their root,
and often cut down at top for this purpose, so that most would not know them in
their flowering season.
</p>

<p>
I do not mean to prescribe rules to strong and valiant natures, who will mind
their own affairs whether in heaven or hell, and perchance build more
magnificently and spend more lavishly than the richest, without ever
impoverishing themselves, not knowing how they live,&mdash;if, indeed, there are
any such, as has been dreamed; nor to those who find their encouragement and
inspiration in precisely the present condition of things, and cherish it with
the fondness and enthusiasm of lovers,&mdash;and, to some extent, I reckon
myself in this number; I do not speak to those who are well employed, in
whatever circumstances, and they know whether they are well employed or
not;&mdash;but mainly to the mass of men who are discontented, and idly
complaining of the hardness of their lot or of the times, when they might
improve them. There are some who complain most energetically and inconsolably
of any, because they are, as they say, doing their duty. I also have in my mind
that seemingly wealthy, but most terribly impoverished class of all, who have
accumulated dross, but know not how to use it, or get rid of it, and thus have
forged their own golden or silver fetters.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
If I should attempt to tell how I have desired to spend my life in years past,
it would probably surprise those of my readers who are somewhat acquainted with
its actual history; it would certainly astonish those who know nothing about
it. I will only hint at some of the enterprises which I have cherished.
</p>

<p>
In any weather, at any hour of the day or night, I have been anxious to improve
the nick of time, and notch it on my stick too; to stand on the meeting of two
eternities, the past and future, which is precisely the present moment; to toe
that line. You will pardon some obscurities, for there are more secrets in my
trade than in most men&rsquo;s, and yet not voluntarily kept, but inseparable
from its very nature. I would gladly tell all that I know about it, and never
paint &ldquo;No Admittance&rdquo; on my gate.
</p>

<p>
I long ago lost a hound, a bay horse, and a turtle-dove, and am still on their
trail. Many are the travellers I have spoken concerning them, describing their
tracks and what calls they answered to. I have met one or two who had heard the
hound, and the tramp of the horse, and even seen the dove disappear behind a
cloud, and they seemed as anxious to recover them as if they had lost them
themselves.
</p>

<p>
To anticipate, not the sunrise and the dawn merely, but, if possible, Nature
herself! How many mornings, summer and winter, before yet any neighbor was
stirring about his business, have I been about mine! No doubt, many of my
townsmen have met me returning from this enterprise, farmers starting for
Boston in the twilight, or woodchoppers going to their work. It is true, I
never assisted the sun materially in his rising, but, doubt not, it was of the
last importance only to be present at it.
</p>

<p>
So many autumn, ay, and winter days, spent outside the town, trying to hear
what was in the wind, to hear and carry it express! I well-nigh sunk all my
capital in it, and lost my own breath into the bargain, running in the face of
it. If it had concerned either of the political parties, depend upon it, it
would have appeared in the Gazette with the earliest intelligence. At other
times watching from the observatory of some cliff or tree, to telegraph any new
arrival; or waiting at evening on the hill-tops for the sky to fall, that I
might catch something, though I never caught much, and that, manna-wise, would
dissolve again in the sun.
</p>

<p>
For a long time I was reporter to a journal, of no very wide circulation, whose
editor has never yet seen fit to print the bulk of my contributions, and, as is
too common with writers, I got only my labor for my pains. However, in this
case my pains were their own reward.
</p>

<p>
For many years I was self-appointed inspector of snow storms and rain storms,
and did my duty faithfully; surveyor, if not of highways, then of forest paths
and all across-lot routes, keeping them open, and ravines bridged and passable
at all seasons, where the public heel had testified to their utility.
</p>

<p>
I have looked after the wild stock of the town, which give a faithful herdsman
a good deal of trouble by leaping fences; and I have had an eye to the
unfrequented nooks and corners of the farm; though I did not always know
whether Jonas or Solomon worked in a particular field to-day; that was none of
my business. I have watered the red huckleberry, the sand cherry and the
nettle tree, the red pine and the black ash, the white grape and the yellow
violet, which might have withered else in dry seasons.
</p>

<p>
In short, I went on thus for a long time, I may say it without boasting,
faithfully minding my business, till it became more and more evident that my
townsmen would not after all admit me into the list of town officers, nor make
my place a sinecure with a moderate allowance. My accounts, which I can swear
to have kept faithfully, I have, indeed, never got audited, still less
accepted, still less paid and settled. However, I have not set my heart on
that.
</p>

<p>
Not long since, a strolling Indian went to sell baskets at the house of a
well-known lawyer in my neighborhood. &ldquo;Do you wish to buy any
baskets?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;No, we do not want any,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed the Indian as he went out the gate, &ldquo;do you
mean to starve us?&rdquo; Having seen his industrious white neighbors so well
off,&mdash;that the lawyer had only to weave arguments, and by some magic,
wealth and standing followed, he had said to himself; I will go into
business; I will weave baskets; it is a thing which I can do. Thinking that
when he had made the baskets he would have done his part, and then it would be
the white man&rsquo;s to buy them. He had not discovered that it was necessary
for him to make it worth the other&rsquo;s while to buy them, or at least make
him think that it was so, or to make something else which it would be worth his
while to buy. I too had woven a kind of basket of a delicate texture, but I had
not made it worth any one&rsquo;s while to buy them. Yet not the less, in my
case, did I think it worth my while to weave them, and instead of studying how
to make it worth men&rsquo;s while to buy my baskets, I studied rather how to
avoid the necessity of selling them. The life which men praise and regard as
successful is but one kind. Why should we exaggerate any one kind at the
expense of the others?
</p>

<p>
Finding that my fellow-citizens were not likely to offer me any room in the
court house, or any curacy or living any where else, but I must shift for
myself, I turned my face more exclusively than ever to the woods, where I was
better known. I determined to go into business at once, and not wait to acquire
the usual capital, using such slender means as I had already got. My purpose in
going to Walden Pond was not to live cheaply nor to live dearly there, but to
transact some private business with the fewest obstacles; to be hindered from
accomplishing which for want of a little common sense, a little enterprise and
business talent, appeared not so sad as foolish.
</p>

<p>
I have always endeavored to acquire strict business habits; they are
indispensable to every man. If your trade is with the Celestial Empire, then
some small counting house on the coast, in some Salem harbor, will be fixture
enough. You will export such articles as the country affords, purely native
products, much ice and pine timber and a little granite, always in native
bottoms. These will be good ventures. To oversee all the details yourself in
person; to be at once pilot and captain, and owner and underwriter; to buy and
sell and keep the accounts; to read every letter received, and write or read
every letter sent; to superintend the discharge of imports night and day; to be
upon many parts of the coast almost at the same time;&mdash;often the richest
freight will be discharged upon a Jersey shore;&mdash;to be your own telegraph,
unweariedly sweeping the horizon, speaking all passing vessels bound coastwise;
to keep up a steady despatch of commodities, for the supply of such a distant
and exorbitant market; to keep yourself informed of the state of the markets,
prospects of war and peace every where, and anticipate the tendencies of trade
and civilization,&mdash;taking advantage of the results of all exploring
expeditions, using new passages and all improvements in
navigation;&mdash;charts to be studied, the position of reefs and new lights
and buoys to be ascertained, and ever, and ever, the logarithmic tables to be
corrected, for by the error of some calculator the vessel often splits upon a
rock that should have reached a friendly pier,&mdash;there is the untold fate of
La Perouse;&mdash;universal science to be kept pace with, studying the lives of
all great discoverers and navigators, great adventurers and merchants, from
Hanno and the Ph≈ìnicians down to our day; in fine, account of stock to be
taken from time to time, to know how you stand. It is a labor to task the
faculties of a man,&mdash;such problems of profit and loss, of interest, of tare
and tret, and gauging of all kinds in it, as demand a universal knowledge.
</p>

<p>
I have thought that Walden Pond would be a good place for business, not solely
on account of the railroad and the ice trade; it offers advantages which it may
not be good policy to divulge; it is a good port and a good foundation. No Neva
marshes to be filled; though you must every where build on piles of your own
driving. It is said that a flood-tide, with a westerly wind, and ice in the
Neva, would sweep St. Petersburg from the face of the earth.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
As this business was to be entered into without the usual capital, it may not
be easy to conjecture where those means, that will still be indispensable to
every such undertaking, were to be obtained. As for Clothing, to come at once
to the practical part of the question, perhaps we are led oftener by the love
of novelty, and a regard for the opinions of men, in procuring it, than by a
true utility. Let him who has work to do recollect that the object of clothing
is, first, to retain the vital heat, and secondly, in this state of society, to
cover nakedness, and he may judge how much of any necessary or important work
may be accomplished without adding to his wardrobe. Kings and queens who wear a
suit but once, though made by some tailor or dressmaker to their majesties,
cannot know the comfort of wearing a suit that fits. They are no better than
wooden horses to hang the clean clothes on. Every day our garments become more
assimilated to ourselves, receiving the impress of the wearer&rsquo;s
character, until we hesitate to lay them aside, without such delay and medical
appliances and some such solemnity even as our bodies. No man ever stood the
lower in my estimation for having a patch in his clothes; yet I am sure that
there is greater anxiety, commonly, to have fashionable, or at least clean and
unpatched clothes, than to have a sound conscience. But even if the rent is not
mended, perhaps the worst vice betrayed is improvidence. I sometimes try my
acquaintances by such tests as this;&mdash;who could wear a patch, or two extra
seams only, over the knee? Most behave as if they believed that their prospects
for life would be ruined if they should do it. It would be easier for them to
hobble to town with a broken leg than with a broken pantaloon. Often if an
accident happens to a gentleman&rsquo;s legs, they can be mended; but if a
similar accident happens to the legs of his pantaloons, there is no help for
it; for he considers, not what is truly respectable, but what is respected. We
know but few men, a great many coats and breeches. Dress a scarecrow in your
last shift, you standing shiftless by, who would not soonest salute the
scarecrow? Passing a cornfield the other day, close by a hat and coat on a
stake, I recognized the owner of the farm. He was only a little more
weather-beaten than when I saw him last. I have heard of a dog that barked at
every stranger who approached his master&rsquo;s premises with clothes on, but
was easily quieted by a naked thief. It is an interesting question how far men
would retain their relative rank if they were divested of their clothes. Could
you, in such a case, tell surely of any company of civilized men, which
belonged to the most respected class? When Madam Pfeiffer, in her adventurous
travels round the world, from east to west, had got so near home as Asiatic
Russia, she says that she felt the necessity of wearing other than a travelling
dress, when she went to meet the authorities, for she &ldquo;was now in a
civilized country, where &mdash;&mdash; &mdash; people are judged of by their
clothes.&rdquo; Even in our democratic New England towns the accidental
possession of wealth, and its manifestation in dress and equipage alone, obtain
for the possessor almost universal respect. But they yield such respect,
numerous as they are, are so far heathen, and need to have a missionary sent to
them. Beside, clothes introduced sewing, a kind of work which you may call
endless; a woman&rsquo;s dress, at least, is never done.
</p>

<p>
A man who has at length found something to do will not need to get a new suit
to do it in; for him the old will do, that has lain dusty in the garret for an
indeterminate period. Old shoes will serve a hero longer than they have served
his valet,&mdash;if a hero ever has a valet,&mdash;bare feet are older than
shoes, and he can make them do. Only they who go to soir√©es and legislative
halls must have new coats, coats to change as often as the man changes in them.
But if my jacket and trousers, my hat and shoes, are fit to worship God in,
they will do; will they not? Who ever saw his old clothes,&mdash;his old coat,
actually worn out, resolved into its primitive elements, so that it was not a
deed of charity to bestow it on some poor boy, by him perchance to be bestowed
on some poorer still, or shall we say richer, who could do with less? I say,
beware of all enterprises that require new clothes, and not rather a new wearer
of clothes. If there is not a new man, how can the new clothes be made to fit?
If you have any enterprise before you, try it in your old clothes. All men
want, not something to <i>do with</i>, but something to <i>do</i>, or rather
something to <i>be</i>. Perhaps we should never procure a new suit, however
ragged or dirty the old, until we have so conducted, so enterprised or sailed
in some way, that we feel like new men in the old, and that to retain it would
be like keeping new wine in old bottles. Our moulting season, like that of the
fowls, must be a crisis in our lives. The loon retires to solitary ponds to
spend it. Thus also the snake casts its slough, and the caterpillar its wormy
coat, by an internal industry and expansion; for clothes are but our outmost
cuticle and mortal coil. Otherwise we shall be found sailing under false
colors, and be inevitably cashiered at last by our own opinion, as well as that
of mankind.
</p>

<p>
We don garment after garment, as if we grew like exogenous plants by addition
without. Our outside and often thin and fanciful clothes are our epidermis, or
false skin, which partakes not of our life, and may be stripped off here and
there without fatal injury; our thicker garments, constantly worn, are our
cellular integument, or cortex; but our shirts are our liber or true bark,
which cannot be removed without girdling and so destroying the man. I believe
that all races at some seasons wear something equivalent to the shirt. It is
desirable that a man be clad so simply that he can lay his hands on himself in
the dark, and that he live in all respects so compactly and preparedly, that, if
an enemy take the town, he can, like the old philosopher, walk out the gate
empty-handed without anxiety. While one thick garment is, for most purposes, as
good as three thin ones, and cheap clothing can be obtained at prices really to
suit customers; while a thick coat can be bought for five dollars, which will
last as many years, thick pantaloons for two dollars, cowhide boots for a
dollar and a half a pair, a summer hat for a quarter of a dollar, and a winter
cap for sixty-two and a half cents, or a better be made at home at a nominal
cost, where is he so poor that, clad in such a suit, of <i>his own earning</i>,
there will not be found wise men to do him reverence?
</p>

<p>
When I ask for a garment of a particular form, my tailoress tells me gravely,
&ldquo;They do not make them so now,&rdquo; not emphasizing the
&ldquo;They&rdquo; at all, as if she quoted an authority as impersonal as the
Fates, and I find it difficult to get made what I want, simply because she
cannot believe that I mean what I say, that I am so rash. When I hear this
oracular sentence, I am for a moment absorbed in thought, emphasizing to myself
each word separately that I may come at the meaning of it, that I may find out
by what degree of consanguinity <i>They</i> are related to <i>me</i>, and what
authority they may have in an affair which affects me so nearly; and, finally,
I am inclined to answer her with equal mystery, and without any more emphasis
of the &ldquo;they,&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;It is true, they did not make them so
recently, but they do now.&rdquo; Of what use this measuring of me if she does
not measure my character, but only the breadth of my shoulders, as it were a
peg to hang the coat on? We worship not the Graces, nor the Parc√¶, but
Fashion. She spins and weaves and cuts with full authority. The head monkey at
Paris puts on a traveller&rsquo;s cap, and all the monkeys in America do the
same. I sometimes despair of getting anything quite simple and honest done in
this world by the help of men. They would have to be passed through a powerful
press first, to squeeze their old notions out of them, so that they would not
soon get upon their legs again, and then there would be some one in the company
with a maggot in his head, hatched from an egg deposited there nobody knows
when, for not even fire kills these things, and you would have lost your labor.
Nevertheless, we will not forget that some Egyptian wheat was handed down to us
by a mummy.
</p>

<p>
On the whole, I think that it cannot be maintained that dressing has in this or
any country risen to the dignity of an art. At present men make shift to wear
what they can get. Like shipwrecked sailors, they put on what they can find on
the beach, and at a little distance, whether of space or time, laugh at each
other&rsquo;s masquerade. Every generation laughs at the old fashions, but
follows religiously the new. We are amused at beholding the costume of Henry
VIII., or Queen Elizabeth, as much as if it was that of the King and Queen of
the Cannibal Islands. All costume off a man is pitiful or grotesque. It is only
the serious eye peering from and the sincere life passed within it, which
restrain laughter and consecrate the costume of any people. Let Harlequin be
taken with a fit of the colic and his trappings will have to serve that mood
too. When the soldier is hit by a cannon ball rags are as becoming as purple.
</p>

<p>
The childish and savage taste of men and women for new patterns keeps how many
shaking and squinting through kaleidoscopes that they may discover the
particular figure which this generation requires today. The manufacturers have
learned that this taste is merely whimsical. Of two patterns which differ only
by a few threads more or less of a particular color, the one will be sold
readily, the other lie on the shelf, though it frequently happens that after
the lapse of a season the latter becomes the most fashionable. Comparatively,
tattooing is not the hideous custom which it is called. It is not barbarous
merely because the printing is skin-deep and unalterable.
</p>

<p>
I cannot believe that our factory system is the best mode by which men may get
clothing. The condition of the operatives is becoming every day more like that
of the English; and it cannot be wondered at, since, as far as I have heard or
observed, the principal object is, not that mankind may be well and honestly
clad, but, unquestionably, that corporations may be enriched. In the long run
men hit only what they aim at. Therefore, though they should fail immediately,
they had better aim at something high.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
As for a Shelter, I will not deny that this is now a necessary of life, though
there are instances of men having done without it for long periods in colder
countries than this. Samuel Laing says that &ldquo;the Laplander in his skin
dress, and in a skin bag which he puts over his head and shoulders, will sleep
night after night on the snow&mdash;in a degree of cold which would extinguish
the life of one exposed to it in any woollen clothing.&rdquo; He had seen them
asleep thus. Yet he adds, &ldquo;They are not hardier than other people.&rdquo;
But, probably, man did not live long on the earth without discovering the
convenience which there is in a house, the domestic comforts, which phrase may
have originally signified the satisfactions of the house more than of the
family; though these must be extremely partial and occasional in those climates
where the house is associated in our thoughts with winter or the rainy season
chiefly, and two thirds of the year, except for a parasol, is unnecessary. In
our climate, in the summer, it was formerly almost solely a covering at night.
In the Indian gazettes a wigwam was the symbol of a day&rsquo;s march, and a
row of them cut or painted on the bark of a tree signified that so many times
they had camped. Man was not made so large limbed and robust but that he must
seek to narrow his world, and wall in a space such as fitted him. He was at
first bare and out of doors; but though this was pleasant enough in serene and
warm weather, by daylight, the rainy season and the winter, to say nothing of
the torrid sun, would perhaps have nipped his race in the bud if he had not
made haste to clothe himself with the shelter of a house. Adam and Eve,
according to the fable, wore the bower before other clothes. Man wanted a home,
a place of warmth, or comfort, first of physical warmth, then the warmth of the
affections.
</p>

<p>
We may imagine a time when, in the infancy of the human race, some enterprising
mortal crept into a hollow in a rock for shelter. Every child begins the world
again, to some extent, and loves to stay out doors, even in wet and cold. It
plays house, as well as horse, having an instinct for it. Who does not remember
the interest with which when young he looked at shelving rocks, or any approach
to a cave? It was the natural yearning of that portion of our most primitive
ancestor which still survived in us. From the cave we have advanced to roofs of
palm leaves, of bark and boughs, of linen woven and stretched, of grass and
straw, of boards and shingles, of stones and tiles. At last, we know not what
it is to live in the open air, and our lives are domestic in more senses than
we think. From the hearth to the field is a great distance. It would be well
perhaps if we were to spend more of our days and nights without any
obstruction between us and the celestial bodies, if the poet did not speak so
much from under a roof, or the saint dwell there so long. Birds do not sing in
caves, nor do doves cherish their innocence in dovecots.
</p>

<p>
However, if one designs to construct a dwelling house, it behooves him to
exercise a little Yankee shrewdness, lest after all he find himself in a
workhouse, a labyrinth without a clue, a museum, an almshouse, a prison, or a
splendid mausoleum instead. Consider first how slight a shelter is absolutely
necessary. I have seen Penobscot Indians, in this town, living in tents of thin
cotton cloth, while the snow was nearly a foot deep around them, and I thought
that they would be glad to have it deeper to keep out the wind. Formerly, when
how to get my living honestly, with freedom left for my proper pursuits, was a
question which vexed me even more than it does now, for unfortunately I am
become somewhat callous, I used to see a large box by the railroad, six feet
long by three wide, in which the laborers locked up their tools at night, and
it suggested to me that every man who was hard pushed might get such a one for
a dollar, and, having bored a few auger holes in it, to admit the air at least,
get into it when it rained and at night, and hook down the lid, and so have
freedom in his love, and in his soul be free. This did not appear the worst,
nor by any means a despicable alternative. You could sit up as late as you
pleased, and, whenever you got up, go abroad without any landlord or house-lord
dogging you for rent. Many a man is harassed to death to pay the rent of a
larger and more luxurious box who would not have frozen to death in such a box
as this. I am far from jesting. Economy is a subject which admits of being
treated with levity, but it cannot so be disposed of. A comfortable house for a
rude and hardy race, that lived mostly out of doors, was once made here almost
entirely of such materials as Nature furnished ready to their hands. Gookin,
who was superintendent of the Indians subject to the Massachusetts Colony,
writing in 1674, says, &ldquo;The best of their houses are covered very neatly,
tight and warm, with barks of trees, slipped from their bodies at those seasons
when the sap is up, and made into great flakes, with pressure of weighty
timber, when they are green.... The meaner sort are covered with mats which
they make of a kind of bulrush, and are also indifferently tight and warm, but
not so good as the former.... Some I have seen, sixty or a hundred feet long
and thirty feet broad.... I have often lodged in their wigwams, and found them
as warm as the best English houses.&rdquo; He adds, that they were commonly
carpeted and lined within with well-wrought embroidered mats, and were
furnished with various utensils. The Indians had advanced so far as to regulate
the effect of the wind by a mat suspended over the hole in the roof and moved
by a string. Such a lodge was in the first instance constructed in a day or two
at most, and taken down and put up in a few hours; and every family owned one,
or its apartment in one.
</p>

<p>
In the savage state every family owns a shelter as good as the best, and
sufficient for its coarser and simpler wants; but I think that I speak within
bounds when I say that, though the birds of the air have their nests, and the
foxes their holes, and the savages their wigwams, in modern civilized society
not more than one half the families own a shelter. In the large towns and
cities, where civilization especially prevails, the number of those who own a
shelter is a very small fraction of the whole. The rest pay an annual tax for
this outside garment of all, become indispensable summer and winter, which
would buy a village of Indian wigwams, but now helps to keep them poor as long
as they live. I do not mean to insist here on the disadvantage of hiring
compared with owning, but it is evident that the savage owns his shelter
because it costs so little, while the civilized man hires his commonly because
he cannot afford to own it; nor can he, in the long run, any better afford to
hire. But, answers one, by merely paying this tax the poor civilized man
secures an abode which is a palace compared with the savage&rsquo;s. An annual
rent of from twenty-five to a hundred dollars, these are the country rates,
entitles him to the benefit of the improvements of centuries, spacious
apartments, clean paint and paper, Rumford fireplace, back plastering, Venetian
blinds, copper pump, spring lock, a commodious cellar, and many other things.
But how happens it that he who is said to enjoy these things is so commonly a
<i>poor</i> civilized man, while the savage, who has them not, is rich as a
savage? If it is asserted that civilization is a real advance in the condition
of man,&mdash;and I think that it is, though only the wise improve their
advantages,&mdash;it must be shown that it has produced better dwellings
without making them more costly; and the cost of a thing is the amount of what
I will call life which is required to be exchanged for it, immediately or in
the long run. An average house in this neighborhood costs perhaps eight hundred
dollars, and to lay up this sum will take from ten to fifteen years of the
laborer&rsquo;s life, even if he is not encumbered with a
family;&mdash;estimating the pecuniary value of every man&rsquo;s labor at one
dollar a day, for if some receive more, others receive less;&mdash;so that he
must have spent more than half his life commonly before <i>his</i> wigwam will
be earned. If we suppose him to pay a rent instead, this is but a doubtful
choice of evils. Would the savage have been wise to exchange his wigwam for a
palace on these terms?
</p>

<p>
It may be guessed that I reduce almost the whole advantage of holding this
superfluous property as a fund in store against the future, so far as the
individual is concerned, mainly to the defraying of funeral expenses. But
perhaps a man is not required to bury himself. Nevertheless this points to an
important distinction between the civilized man and the savage; and, no doubt,
they have designs on us for our benefit, in making the life of a civilized
people an <i>institution</i>, in which the life of the individual is to a great
extent absorbed, in order to preserve and perfect that of the race. But I wish
to show at what a sacrifice this advantage is at present obtained, and to
suggest that we may possibly so live as to secure all the advantage without
suffering any of the disadvantage. What mean ye by saying that the poor ye have
always with you, or that the fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the
children&rsquo;s teeth are set on edge?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As I live, saith the Lord God, ye shall not have occasion any more to
use this proverb in Israel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Behold all souls are mine; as the soul of the father, so also the soul
of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, it shall die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When I consider my neighbors, the farmers of Concord, who are at least as well
off as the other classes, I find that for the most part they have been toiling
twenty, thirty, or forty years, that they may become the real owners of their
farms, which commonly they have inherited with encumbrances, or else bought
with hired money,&mdash;and we may regard one third of that toil as the cost of
their houses,&mdash;but commonly they have not paid for them yet. It is true,
the encumbrances sometimes outweigh the value of the farm, so that the farm
itself becomes one great encumbrance, and still a man is found to inherit it,
being well acquainted with it, as he says. On applying to the assessors, I am
surprised to learn that they cannot at once name a dozen in the town who own
their farms free and clear. If you would know the history of these homesteads,
inquire at the bank where they are mortgaged. The man who has actually paid for
his farm with labor on it is so rare that every neighbor can point to him. I
doubt if there are three such men in Concord. What has been said of the
merchants, that a very large majority, even ninety-seven in a hundred, are sure
to fail, is equally true of the farmers. With regard to the merchants, however,
one of them says pertinently that a great part of their failures are not
genuine pecuniary failures, but merely failures to fulfil their engagements,
because it is inconvenient; that is, it is the moral character that breaks
down. But this puts an infinitely worse face on the matter, and suggests,
beside, that probably not even the other three succeed in saving their souls,
but are perchance bankrupt in a worse sense than they who fail honestly.
Bankruptcy and repudiation are the springboards from which much of our
civilization vaults and turns its somersets, but the savage stands on the
unelastic plank of famine. Yet the Middlesex Cattle Show goes off here with
<i>√©clat</i> annually, as if all the joints of the agricultural machine were
suent.
</p>

<p>
The farmer is endeavoring to solve the problem of a livelihood by a formula
more complicated than the problem itself. To get his shoestrings he speculates
in herds of cattle. With consummate skill he has set his trap with a hair
spring to catch comfort and independence, and then, as he turned away, got his
own leg into it. This is the reason he is poor; and for a similar reason we are
all poor in respect to a thousand savage comforts, though surrounded by
luxuries. As Chapman sings,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The false society of men&mdash;<br />
        &mdash;for earthly greatness<br />
All heavenly comforts rarefies to air.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
And when the farmer has got his house, he may not be the richer but the poorer
for it, and it be the house that has got him. As I understand it, that was a
valid objection urged by Momus against the house which Minerva made, that she
&ldquo;had not made it movable, by which means a bad neighborhood might be
avoided;&rdquo; and it may still be urged, for our houses are such unwieldy
property that we are often imprisoned rather than housed in them; and the bad
neighborhood to be avoided is our own scurvy selves. I know one or two
families, at least, in this town, who, for nearly a generation, have been
wishing to sell their houses in the outskirts and move into the village, but
have not been able to accomplish it, and only death will set them free.

<p>
Granted that the <i>majority</i> are able at last either to own or hire the
modern house with all its improvements. While civilization has been improving
our houses, it has not equally improved the men who are to inhabit them. It has
created palaces, but it was not so easy to create noblemen and kings. And <i>if
the civilized man&rsquo;s pursuits are no worthier than the savage&rsquo;s, if
he is employed the greater part of his life in obtaining gross necessaries and
comforts merely, why should he have a better dwelling than the former?</i>
</p>

<p>
But how do the poor minority fare? Perhaps it will be found, that just in
proportion as some have been placed in outward circumstances above the savage,
others have been degraded below him. The luxury of one class is counterbalanced
by the indigence of another. On the one side is the palace, on the other are
the almshouse and &ldquo;silent poor.&rdquo; The myriads who built the pyramids
to be the tombs of the Pharaohs were fed on garlic, and it may be were not
decently buried themselves. The mason who finishes the cornice of the palace
returns at night perchance to a hut not so good as a wigwam. It is a mistake to
suppose that, in a country where the usual evidences of civilization exist, the
condition of a very large body of the inhabitants may not be as degraded as
that of savages. I refer to the degraded poor, not now to the degraded rich. To
know this I should not need to look farther than to the shanties which
every where border our railroads, that last improvement in civilization; where I
see in my daily walks human beings living in sties, and all winter with an open
door, for the sake of light, without any visible, often imaginable, wood pile,
and the forms of both old and young are permanently contracted by the long
habit of shrinking from cold and misery, and the development of all their limbs
and faculties is checked. It certainly is fair to look at that class by whose
labor the works which distinguish this generation are accomplished. Such too,
to a greater or less extent, is the condition of the operatives of every
denomination in England, which is the great workhouse of the world. Or I could
refer you to Ireland, which is marked as one of the white or enlightened spots
on the map. Contrast the physical condition of the Irish with that of the North
American Indian, or the South Sea Islander, or any other savage race before it
was degraded by contact with the civilized man. Yet I have no doubt that that
people&rsquo;s rulers are as wise as the average of civilized rulers. Their
condition only proves what squalidness may consist with civilization. I hardly
need refer now to the laborers in our Southern States who produce the staple
exports of this country, and are themselves a staple production of the South.
But to confine myself to those who are said to be in <i>moderate</i>
circumstances.

<p>
Most men appear never to have considered what a house is, and are actually
though needlessly poor all their lives because they think that they must have
such a one as their neighbors have. As if one were to wear any sort of coat
which the tailor might cut out for him, or, gradually leaving off palmleaf hat
or cap of woodchuck skin, complain of hard times because he could not afford to
buy him a crown! It is possible to invent a house still more convenient and
luxurious than we have, which yet all would admit that man could not afford to
pay for. Shall we always study to obtain more of these things, and not
sometimes to be content with less? Shall the respectable citizen thus gravely
teach, by precept and example, the necessity of the young man&rsquo;s providing
a certain number of superfluous glow-shoes, and umbrellas, and empty guest
chambers for empty guests, before he dies? Why should not our furniture be as
simple as the Arab&rsquo;s or the Indian&rsquo;s? When I think of the
benefactors of the race, whom we have apotheosized as messengers from heaven,
bearers of divine gifts to man, I do not see in my mind any retinue at their
heels, any car-load of fashionable furniture. Or what if I were to
allow&mdash;would it not be a singular allowance?&mdash;that our furniture
should be more complex than the Arab&rsquo;s, in proportion as we are morally
and intellectually his superiors! At present our houses are cluttered and
defiled with it, and a good housewife would sweep out the greater part into the
dust hole, and not leave her morning&rsquo;s work undone. Morning work! By the
blushes of Aurora and the music of Memnon, what should be man&rsquo;s
<i>morning work</i> in this world? I had three pieces of limestone on my desk,
but I was terrified to find that they required to be dusted daily, when the
furniture of my mind was all undusted still, and I threw them out the window in
disgust. How, then, could I have a furnished house? I would rather sit in the
open air, for no dust gathers on the grass, unless where man has broken ground.
</p>

<p>
It is the luxurious and dissipated who set the fashions which the herd so
diligently follow. The traveller who stops at the best houses, so called, soon
discovers this, for the publicans presume him to be a Sardanapalus, and if he
resigned himself to their tender mercies he would soon be completely
emasculated. I think that in the railroad car we are inclined to spend more on
luxury than on safety and convenience, and it threatens without attaining these
to become no better than a modern drawing room, with its divans, and ottomans,
and sun-shades, and a hundred other oriental things, which we are taking west
with us, invented for the ladies of the harem and the effeminate natives of the
Celestial Empire, which Jonathan should be ashamed to know the names of. I
would rather sit on a pumpkin and have it all to myself than be crowded on a
velvet cushion. I would rather ride on earth in an ox cart with a free
circulation, than go to heaven in the fancy car of an excursion train and
breathe a <i>malaria</i> all the way.
</p>

<p>
The very simplicity and nakedness of man&rsquo;s life in the primitive ages
imply this advantage at least, that they left him still but a sojourner in
nature. When he was refreshed with food and sleep he contemplated his journey
again. He dwelt, as it were, in a tent in this world, and was either threading
the valleys, or crossing the plains, or climbing the mountain tops. But lo! men
have become the tools of their tools. The man who independently plucked the
fruits when he was hungry is become a farmer; and he who stood under a tree for
shelter, a housekeeper. We now no longer camp as for a night, but have settled
down on earth and forgotten heaven. We have adopted Christianity merely as an
improved method of <i>agri</i>-culture. We have built for this world a family
mansion, and for the next a family tomb. The best works of art are the
expression of man&rsquo;s struggle to free himself from this condition, but the
effect of our art is merely to make this low state comfortable and that higher
state to be forgotten. There is actually no place in this village for a work of
<i>fine</i> art, if any had come down to us, to stand, for our lives, our
houses and streets, furnish no proper pedestal for it. There is not a nail to
hang a picture on, nor a shelf to receive the bust of a hero or a saint. When I
consider how our houses are built and paid for, or not paid for, and their
internal economy managed and sustained, I wonder that the floor does not give
way under the visitor while he is admiring the gewgaws upon the mantel-piece,
and let him through into the cellar, to some solid and honest though earthy
foundation. I cannot but perceive that this so called rich and refined life is
a thing jumped at, and I do not get on in the enjoyment of the <i>fine</i> arts
which adorn it, my attention being wholly occupied with the jump; for I
remember that the greatest genuine leap, due to human muscles alone, on record,
is that of certain wandering Arabs, who are said to have cleared twenty-five
feet on level ground. Without factitious support, man is sure to come to earth
again beyond that distance. The first question which I am tempted to put to the
proprietor of such great impropriety is, Who bolsters you? Are you one of the
ninety-seven who fail, or of the three who succeed? Answer me these questions,
and then perhaps I may look at your bawbles and find them ornamental. The cart
before the horse is neither beautiful nor useful. Before we can adorn our
houses with beautiful objects the walls must be stripped, and our lives must be
stripped, and beautiful housekeeping and beautiful living be laid for a
foundation: now, a taste for the beautiful is most cultivated out of doors,
where there is no house and no housekeeper.

<p>
Old Johnson, in his &ldquo;Wonder-Working Providence,&rdquo; speaking of the
first settlers of this town, with whom he was contemporary, tells us that
&ldquo;they burrow themselves in the earth for their first shelter under some
hillside, and, casting the soil aloft upon timber, they make a smoky fire
against the earth, at the highest side.&rdquo; They did not &ldquo;provide them
houses,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;till the earth, by the Lord&rsquo;s blessing,
brought forth bread to feed them,&rdquo; and the first year&rsquo;s crop was so
light that &ldquo;they were forced to cut their bread very thin for a long
season.&rdquo; The secretary of the Province of New Netherland, writing in
Dutch, in 1650, for the information of those who wished to take up land there,
states more particularly that &ldquo;those in New Netherland, and especially in
New England, who have no means to build farmhouses at first according to their
wishes, dig a square pit in the ground, cellar fashion, six or seven feet deep,
as long and as broad as they think proper, case the earth inside with wood all
round the wall, and line the wood with the bark of trees or something else to
prevent the caving in of the earth; floor this cellar with plank, and wainscot
it overhead for a ceiling, raise a roof of spars clear up, and cover the spars
with bark or green sods, so that they can live dry and warm in these houses
with their entire families for two, three, and four years, it being understood
that partitions are run through those cellars which are adapted to the size of
the family. The wealthy and principal men in New England, in the beginning of
the colonies, commenced their first dwelling houses in this fashion for two
reasons; firstly, in order not to waste time in building, and not to want food
the next season; secondly, in order not to discourage poor laboring people whom
they brought over in numbers from Fatherland. In the course of three or four
years, when the country became adapted to agriculture, they built themselves
handsome houses, spending on them several thousands.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In this course which our ancestors took there was a show of prudence at least,
as if their principle were to satisfy the more pressing wants first. But are
the more pressing wants satisfied now? When I think of acquiring for myself one
of our luxurious dwellings, I am deterred, for, so to speak, the country is not
yet adapted to <i>human</i> culture, and we are still forced to cut our
<i>spiritual</i> bread far thinner than our forefathers did their wheaten. Not
that all architectural ornament is to be neglected even in the rudest periods;
but let our houses first be lined with beauty, where they come in contact with
our lives, like the tenement of the shellfish, and not overlaid with it. But,
alas! I have been inside one or two of them, and know what they are lined with.
</p>

<p>
Though we are not so degenerate but that we might possibly live in a cave or a
wigwam or wear skins today, it certainly is better to accept the advantages,
though so dearly bought, which the invention and industry of mankind offer. In
such a neighborhood as this, boards and shingles, lime and bricks, are cheaper
and more easily obtained than suitable caves, or whole logs, or bark in
sufficient quantities, or even well-tempered clay or flat stones. I speak
understandingly on this subject, for I have made myself acquainted with it both
theoretically and practically. With a little more wit we might use these
materials so as to become richer than the richest now are, and make our
civilization a blessing. The civilized man is a more experienced and wiser
savage. But to make haste to my own experiment.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
Near the end of March, 1845, I borrowed an axe and went down to the woods by
Walden Pond, nearest to where I intended to build my house, and began to cut
down some tall, arrowy white pines, still in their youth, for timber. It is
difficult to begin without borrowing, but perhaps it is the most generous
course thus to permit your fellow-men to have an interest in your enterprise.
The owner of the axe, as he released his hold on it, said that it was the apple
of his eye; but I returned it sharper than I received it. It was a pleasant
hillside where I worked, covered with pine woods, through which I looked out on
the pond, and a small open field in the woods where pines and hickories were
springing up. The ice in the pond was not yet dissolved, though there were some
open spaces, and it was all dark colored and saturated with water. There were
some slight flurries of snow during the days that I worked there; but for the
most part when I came out on to the railroad, on my way home, its yellow sand
heap stretched away gleaming in the hazy atmosphere, and the rails shone in the
spring sun, and I heard the lark and pewee and other birds already come to
commence another year with us. They were pleasant spring days, in which the
winter of man&rsquo;s discontent was thawing as well as the earth, and the life
that had lain torpid began to stretch itself. One day, when my axe had come off
and I had cut a green hickory for a wedge, driving it with a stone, and had
placed the whole to soak in a pond hole in order to swell the wood, I saw a
striped snake run into the water, and he lay on the bottom, apparently without
inconvenience, as long as I stayed there, or more than a quarter of an hour;
perhaps because he had not yet fairly come out of the torpid state. It appeared
to me that for a like reason men remain in their present low and primitive
condition; but if they should feel the influence of the spring of springs
arousing them, they would of necessity rise to a higher and more ethereal life.
I had previously seen the snakes in frosty mornings in my path with portions of
their bodies still numb and inflexible, waiting for the sun to thaw them. On
the 1st of April it rained and melted the ice, and in the early part of the
day, which was very foggy, I heard a stray goose groping about over the pond
and cackling as if lost, or like the spirit of the fog.
</p>

<p>
So I went on for some days cutting and hewing timber, and also studs and
rafters, all with my narrow axe, not having many communicable or scholar-like
thoughts, singing to myself,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
Men say they know many things;<br />
But lo! they have taken wings,&mdash;<br />
The arts and sciences,<br />
And a thousand appliances;<br />
The wind that blows<br />
Is all that any body knows.<br />
</p>

<p>
I hewed the main timbers six inches square, most of the studs on two sides
only, and the rafters and floor timbers on one side, leaving the rest of the
bark on, so that they were just as straight and much stronger than sawed ones.
Each stick was carefully mortised or tenoned by its stump, for I had borrowed
other tools by this time. My days in the woods were not very long ones; yet I
usually carried my dinner of bread and butter, and read the newspaper in which
it was wrapped, at noon, sitting amid the green pine boughs which I had cut
off, and to my bread was imparted some of their fragrance, for my hands were
covered with a thick coat of pitch. Before I had done I was more the friend
than the foe of the pine tree, though I had cut down some of them, having
become better acquainted with it. Sometimes a rambler in the wood was attracted
by the sound of my axe, and we chatted pleasantly over the chips which I had
made.
</p>

<p>
By the middle of April, for I made no haste in my work, but rather made the
most of it, my house was framed and ready for the raising. I had already bought
the shanty of James Collins, an Irishman who worked on the Fitchburg Railroad,
for boards. James Collins&rsquo; shanty was considered an uncommonly fine one.
When I called to see it he was not at home. I walked about the outside, at
first unobserved from within, the window was so deep and high. It was of small
dimensions, with a peaked cottage roof, and not much else to be seen, the dirt
being raised five feet all around as if it were a compost heap. The roof was
the soundest part, though a good deal warped and made brittle by the sun.
Door-sill there was none, but a perennial passage for the hens under the door
board. Mrs. C. came to the door and asked me to view it from the inside. The
hens were driven in by my approach. It was dark, and had a dirt floor for the
most part, dank, clammy, and aguish, only here a board and there a board which
would not bear removal. She lighted a lamp to show me the inside of the roof
and the walls, and also that the board floor extended under the bed, warning me
not to step into the cellar, a sort of dust hole two feet deep. In her own
words, they were &ldquo;good boards overhead, good boards all around, and a
good window,&rdquo;&mdash;of two whole squares originally, only the cat had
passed out that way lately. There was a stove, a bed, and a place to sit, an
infant in the house where it was born, a silk parasol, gilt-framed
looking-glass, and a patent new coffee mill nailed to an oak sapling, all told.
The bargain was soon concluded, for James had in the meanwhile returned. I to
pay four dollars and twenty-five cents to-night, he to vacate at five to-morrow
morning, selling to nobody else meanwhile: I to take possession at six. It were
well, he said, to be there early, and anticipate certain indistinct but wholly
unjust claims on the score of ground rent and fuel. This he assured me was the
only encumbrance. At six I passed him and his family on the road. One large
bundle held their all,&mdash;bed, coffee-mill, looking-glass, hens,&mdash;all but
the cat, she took to the woods and became a wild cat, and, as I learned
afterward, trod in a trap set for woodchucks, and so became a dead cat at last.
</p>

<p>
I took down this dwelling the same morning, drawing the nails, and removed it
to the pond side by small cartloads, spreading the boards on the grass there to
bleach and warp back again in the sun. One early thrush gave me a note or two
as I drove along the woodland path. I was informed treacherously by a young
Patrick that neighbor Seeley, an Irishman, in the intervals of the carting,
transferred the still tolerable, straight, and drivable nails, staples, and
spikes to his pocket, and then stood when I came back to pass the time of day,
and look freshly up, unconcerned, with spring thoughts, at the devastation;
there being a dearth of work, as he said. He was there to represent
spectatordom, and help make this seemingly insignificant event one with the
removal of the gods of Troy.
</p>

<p>
I dug my cellar in the side of a hill sloping to the south, where a woodchuck
had formerly dug his burrow, down through sumach and blackberry roots, and the
lowest stain of vegetation, six feet square by seven deep, to a fine sand where
potatoes would not freeze in any winter. The sides were left shelving, and not
stoned; but the sun having never shone on them, the sand still keeps its place.
It was but two hours&rsquo; work. I took particular pleasure in this breaking
of ground, for in almost all latitudes men dig into the earth for an equable
temperature. Under the most splendid house in the city is still to be found the
cellar where they store their roots as of old, and long after the
superstructure has disappeared posterity remark its dent in the earth. The
house is still but a sort of porch at the entrance of a burrow.
</p>

<p>
At length, in the beginning of May, with the help of some of my acquaintances,
rather to improve so good an occasion for neighborliness than from any
necessity, I set up the frame of my house. No man was ever more honored in the
character of his raisers than I. They are destined, I trust, to assist at the
raising of loftier structures one day. I began to occupy my house on the 4th of
July, as soon as it was boarded and roofed, for the boards were carefully
feather-edged and lapped, so that it was perfectly impervious to rain; but
before boarding I laid the foundation of a chimney at one end, bringing two
cartloads of stones up the hill from the pond in my arms. I built the chimney
after my hoeing in the fall, before a fire became necessary for warmth, doing
my cooking in the mean while out of doors on the ground, early in the morning:
which mode I still think is in some respects more convenient and agreeable than
the usual one. When it stormed before my bread was baked, I fixed a few boards
over the fire, and sat under them to watch my loaf, and passed some pleasant
hours in that way. In those days, when my hands were much employed, I read but
little, but the least scraps of paper which lay on the ground, my holder, or
tablecloth, afforded me as much entertainment, in fact answered the same
purpose as the Iliad.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
It would be worth the while to build still more deliberately than I did,
considering, for instance, what foundation a door, a window, a cellar, a
garret, have in the nature of man, and perchance never raising any
superstructure until we found a better reason for it than our temporal
necessities even. There is some of the same fitness in a man&rsquo;s building
his own house that there is in a bird&rsquo;s building its own nest. Who knows
but if men constructed their dwellings with their own hands, and provided food
for themselves and families simply and honestly enough, the poetic faculty
would be universally developed, as birds universally sing when they are so
engaged? But alas! we do like cowbirds and cuckoos, which lay their eggs in
nests which other birds have built, and cheer no traveller with their
chattering and unmusical notes. Shall we forever resign the pleasure of
construction to the carpenter? What does architecture amount to in the
experience of the mass of men? I never in all my walks came across a man
engaged in so simple and natural an occupation as building his house. We belong
to the community. It is not the tailor alone who is the ninth part of a man; it
is as much the preacher, and the merchant, and the farmer. Where is this
division of labor to end? and what object does it finally serve? No doubt
another <i>may</i> also think for me; but it is not therefore desirable that he
should do so to the exclusion of my thinking for myself.
</p>

<p>
True, there are architects so called in this country, and I have heard of one
at least possessed with the idea of making architectural ornaments have a core
of truth, a necessity, and hence a beauty, as if it were a revelation to him.
All very well perhaps from his point of view, but only a little better than the
common dilettantism. A sentimental reformer in architecture, he began at the
cornice, not at the foundation. It was only how to put a core of truth within
the ornaments, that every sugar plum in fact might have an almond or caraway
seed in it,&mdash;though I hold that almonds are most wholesome without the
sugar,&mdash;and not how the inhabitant, the indweller, might build truly
within and without, and let the ornaments take care of themselves. What
reasonable man ever supposed that ornaments were something outward and in the
skin merely,&mdash;that the tortoise got his spotted shell, or the shellfish
its mother-o&rsquo;-pearl tints, by such a contract as the inhabitants of
Broadway their Trinity Church? But a man has no more to do with the style of
architecture of his house than a tortoise with that of its shell: nor need the
soldier be so idle as to try to paint the precise color of his virtue on his
standard. The enemy will find it out. He may turn pale when the trial comes.
This man seemed to me to lean over the cornice, and timidly whisper his half
truth to the rude occupants who really knew it better than he. What of
architectural beauty I now see, I know has gradually grown from within outward,
out of the necessities and character of the indweller, who is the only
builder,&mdash;out of some unconscious truthfulness, and nobleness, without
ever a thought for the appearance and whatever additional beauty of this kind
is destined to be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty of
life. The most interesting dwellings in this country, as the painter knows, are
the most unpretending, humble log huts and cottages of the poor commonly; it is
the life of the inhabitants whose shells they are, and not any peculiarity in
their surfaces merely, which makes them <i>picturesque;</i> and equally
interesting will be the citizen&rsquo;s suburban box, when his life shall be as
simple and as agreeable to the imagination, and there is as little straining
after effect in the style of his dwelling. A great proportion of architectural
ornaments are literally hollow, and a September gale would strip them off, like
borrowed plumes, without injury to the substantials. They can do without
<i>architecture</i> who have no olives nor wines in the cellar. What if an
equal ado were made about the ornaments of style in literature, and the
architects of our bibles spent as much time about their cornices as the
architects of our churches do? So are made the <i>belles-lettres</i> and the
<i>beaux-arts</i> and their professors. Much it concerns a man, forsooth, how a
few sticks are slanted over him or under him, and what colors are daubed upon
his box. It would signify somewhat, if, in any earnest sense, <i>he</i> slanted
them and daubed it; but the spirit having departed out of the tenant, it is of
a piece with constructing his own coffin,&mdash;the architecture of the grave,
and &ldquo;carpenter&rdquo; is but another name for &ldquo;coffin-maker.&rdquo;
One man says, in his despair or indifference to life, take up a handful of the
earth at your feet, and paint your house that color. Is he thinking of his last
and narrow house? Toss up a copper for it as well. What an abundance of leisure
he must have! Why do you take up a handful of dirt? Better paint your house
your own complexion; let it turn pale or blush for you. An enterprise to
improve the style of cottage architecture! When you have got my ornaments
ready I will wear them.
</p>

<p>
Before winter I built a chimney, and shingled the sides of my house, which were
already impervious to rain, with imperfect and sappy shingles made of the first
slice of the log, whose edges I was obliged to straighten with a plane.
</p>

<p>
I have thus a tight shingled and plastered house, ten feet wide by fifteen
long, and eight-feet posts, with a garret and a closet, a large window on each
side, two trap doors, one door at the end, and a brick fireplace opposite. The
exact cost of my house, paying the usual price for such materials as I used,
but not counting the work, all of which was done by myself, was as follows; and
I give the details because very few are able to tell exactly what their houses
cost, and fewer still, if any, the separate cost of the various materials which
compose them:&mdash;
</p>

<pre xml:space="preserve">
    Boards.......................... $ 8.03¬Ω, mostly shanty boards.
    Refuse shingles for roof sides,..  4.00

        In all,..................... $28.12¬Ω
</pre>

<p>
These are all the materials excepting the timber stones and sand, which I
claimed by squatter&rsquo;s right. I have also a small wood-shed adjoining,
made chiefly of the stuff which was left after building the house.
</p>

<p>
I intend to build me a house which will surpass any on the main street in
Concord in grandeur and luxury, as soon as it pleases me as much and will cost
me no more than my present one.
</p>

<p>
I thus found that the student who wishes for a shelter can obtain one for a
lifetime at an expense not greater than the rent which he now pays annually. If
I seem to boast more than is becoming, my excuse is that I brag for humanity
rather than for myself; and my shortcomings and inconsistencies do not affect
the truth of my statement. Notwithstanding much cant and hypocrisy,&mdash;chaff
which I find it difficult to separate from my wheat, but for which I am as
sorry as any man,&mdash;I will breathe freely and stretch myself in this
respect, it is such a relief to both the moral and physical system; and I am
resolved that I will not through humility become the devil&rsquo;s attorney. I
will endeavor to speak a good word for the truth. At Cambridge College the mere
rent of a student&rsquo;s room, which is only a little larger than my own, is
thirty dollars each year, though the corporation had the advantage of building
thirty-two side by side and under one roof, and the occupant suffers the
inconvenience of many and noisy neighbors, and perhaps a residence in the
fourth story. I cannot but think that if we had more true wisdom in these
respects, not only less education would be needed, because, forsooth, more
would already have been acquired, but the pecuniary expense of getting an
education would in a great measure vanish. Those conveniences which the student
requires at Cambridge or elsewhere cost him or somebody else ten times as great
a sacrifice of life as they would with proper management on both sides. Those
things for which the most money is demanded are never the things which the
student most wants. Tuition, for instance, is an important item in the term
bill, while for the far more valuable education which he gets by associating
with the most cultivated of his contemporaries no charge is made. The mode of
founding a college is, commonly, to get up a subscription of dollars and cents,
and then following blindly the principles of a division of labor to its
extreme, a principle which should never be followed but with
circumspection,&mdash;to call in a contractor who makes this a subject of
speculation, and he employs Irishmen or other operatives actually to lay the
foundations, while the students that are to be are said to be fitting
themselves for it; and for these oversights successive generations have to pay.
I think that it would be <i>better than this</i>, for the students, or those
who desire to be benefited by it, even to lay the foundation themselves. The
student who secures his coveted leisure and retirement by systematically
shirking any labor necessary to man obtains but an ignoble and unprofitable
leisure, defrauding himself of the experience which alone can make leisure
fruitful. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; says one, &ldquo;you do not mean that the students
should go to work with their hands instead of their heads?&rdquo; I do not mean
that exactly, but I mean something which he might think a good deal like that;
I mean that they should not <i>play</i> life, or <i>study</i> it merely, while
the community supports them at this expensive game, but earnestly <i>live</i>
it from beginning to end. How could youths better learn to live than by at once
trying the experiment of living? Methinks this would exercise their minds as
much as mathematics. If I wished a boy to know something about the arts and
sciences, for instance, I would not pursue the common course, which is merely
to send him into the neighborhood of some professor, where any thing is
professed and practised but the art of life;&mdash;to survey the world through
a telescope or a microscope, and never with his natural eye; to study
chemistry, and not learn how his bread is made, or mechanics, and not learn how
it is earned; to discover new satellites to Neptune, and not detect the motes
in his eyes, or to what vagabond he is a satellite himself; or to be devoured
by the monsters that swarm all around him, while contemplating the monsters in
a drop of vinegar. Which would have advanced the most at the end of a
month,&mdash;the boy who had made his own jackknife from the ore which he had
dug and smelted, reading as much as would be necessary for this,&mdash;or the
boy who had attended the lectures on metallurgy at the Institute in the mean
while, and had received a Rodgers&rsquo; penknife from his father? Which would
be most likely to cut his fingers?... To my astonishment I was informed on
leaving college that I had studied navigation!&mdash;why, if I had taken one
turn down the harbor I should have known more about it. Even the <i>poor</i>
student studies and is taught only <i>political</i> economy, while that economy
of living which is synonymous with philosophy is not even sincerely professed
in our colleges. The consequence is, that while he is reading Adam Smith,
Ricardo, and Say, he runs his father in debt irretrievably.
</p>

<p>
As with our colleges, so with a hundred &ldquo;modern improvements&rdquo;;
there is an illusion about them; there is not always a positive advance. The
devil goes on exacting compound interest to the last for his early share and
numerous succeeding investments in them. Our inventions are wont to be pretty
toys, which distract our attention from serious things. They are but improved
means to an unimproved end, an end which it was already but too easy to arrive
at; as railroads lead to Boston or New York. We are in great haste to construct
a magnetic telegraph from Maine to Texas; but Maine and Texas, it may be, have
nothing important to communicate. Either is in such a predicament as the man
who was earnest to be introduced to a distinguished deaf woman, but when he was
presented, and one end of her ear trumpet was put into his hand, had nothing to
say. As if the main object were to talk fast and not to talk sensibly. We are
eager to tunnel under the Atlantic and bring the old world some weeks nearer to
the new; but perchance the first news that will leak through into the broad,
flapping American ear will be that the Princess Adelaide has the whooping
cough. After all, the man whose horse trots a mile in a minute does not carry
the most important messages; he is not an evangelist, nor does he come round
eating locusts and wild honey. I doubt if Flying Childers ever carried a peck
of corn to mill.
</p>

<p>
One says to me, &ldquo;I wonder that you do not lay up money; you love to
travel; you might take the cars and go to Fitchburg to-day and see the
country.&rdquo; But I am wiser than that. I have learned that the swiftest
traveller is he that goes afoot. I say to my friend, Suppose we try who will
get there first. The distance is thirty miles; the fare ninety cents. That is
almost a day&rsquo;s wages. I remember when wages were sixty cents a day for
laborers on this very road. Well, I start now on foot, and get there before
night; I have travelled at that rate by the week together. You will in the
mean while have earned your fare, and arrive there some time to-morrow, or
possibly this evening, if you are lucky enough to get a job in season. Instead
of going to Fitchburg, you will be working here the greater part of the day.
And so, if the railroad reached round the world, I think that I should keep
ahead of you; and as for seeing the country and getting experience of that
kind, I should have to cut your acquaintance altogether.
</p>

<p>
Such is the universal law, which no man can ever outwit, and with regard to the
railroad even we may say it is as broad as it is long. To make a railroad round
the world available to all mankind is equivalent to grading the whole surface
of the planet. Men have an indistinct notion that if they keep up this activity
of joint stocks and spades long enough all will at length ride somewhere, in
next to no time, and for nothing; but though a crowd rushes to the depot, and
the conductor shouts &ldquo;All aboard!&rdquo; when the smoke is blown away and
the vapor condensed, it will be perceived that a few are riding, but the rest
are run over,&mdash;and it will be called, and will be, &ldquo;A melancholy
accident.&rdquo; No doubt they can ride at last who shall have earned their
fare, that is, if they survive so long, but they will probably have lost their
elasticity and desire to travel by that time. This spending of the best part of
one&rsquo;s life earning money in order to enjoy a questionable liberty during
the least valuable part of it, reminds me of the Englishman who went to India
to make a fortune first, in order that he might return to England and live the
life of a poet. He should have gone up garret at once. &ldquo;What!&rdquo;
exclaim a million Irishmen starting up from all the shanties in the land,
&ldquo;is not this railroad which we have built a good thing?&rdquo; Yes, I
answer, <i>comparatively</i> good, that is, you might have done worse; but I
wish, as you are brothers of mine, that you could have spent your time better
than digging in this dirt.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
Before I finished my house, wishing to earn ten or twelve dollars by some
honest and agreeable method, in order to meet my unusual expenses, I planted
about two acres and a half of light and sandy soil near it chiefly with beans,
but also a small part with potatoes, corn, peas, and turnips. The whole lot
contains eleven acres, mostly growing up to pines and hickories, and was sold
the preceding season for eight dollars and eight cents an acre. One farmer said
that it was &ldquo;good for nothing but to raise cheeping squirrels on.&rdquo;
I put no manure whatever on this land, not being the owner, but merely a
squatter, and not expecting to cultivate so much again, and I did not quite hoe
it all once. I got out several cords of stumps in ploughing, which supplied me
with fuel for a long time, and left small circles of virgin mould, easily
distinguishable through the summer by the greater luxuriance of the beans
there. The dead and for the most part unmerchantable wood behind my house, and
the driftwood from the pond, have supplied the remainder of my fuel. I was
obliged to hire a team and a man for the ploughing, though I held the plough
myself. My farm outgoes for the first season were, for implements, seed, work,
&amp;c., $14.72¬Ω. The seed corn was given me. This never costs anything to
speak of, unless you plant more than enough. I got twelve bushels of beans, and
eighteen bushels of potatoes, beside some peas and sweet corn. The yellow corn
and turnips were too late to come to any thing. My whole income from the farm
was

      There are left,................. $  8.71¬Ω,
</pre>

<p class="noindent">
beside produce consumed and on hand at the time this estimate was made of the
value of $4.50,&mdash;the amount on hand much more than balancing a little
grass which I did not raise. All things considered, that is, considering the
importance of a man&rsquo;s soul and of to-day, notwithstanding the short time
occupied by my experiment, nay, partly even because of its transient character,
I believe that that was doing better than any farmer in Concord did that year.
</p>

<p>
The next year I did better still, for I spaded up all the land which I
required, about a third of an acre, and I learned from the experience of both
years, not being in the least awed by many celebrated works on husbandry,
Arthur Young among the rest, that if one would live simply and eat only the
crop which he raised, and raise no more than he ate, and not exchange it for an
insufficient quantity of more luxurious and expensive things, he would need to
cultivate only a few rods of ground, and that it would be cheaper to spade up
that than to use oxen to plough it, and to select a fresh spot from time to
time than to manure the old, and he could do all his necessary farm work as it
were with his left hand at odd hours in the summer; and thus he would not be
tied to an ox, or horse, or cow, or pig, as at present. I desire to speak
impartially on this point, and as one not interested in the success or failure
of the present economical and social arrangements. I was more independent than
any farmer in Concord, for I was not anchored to a house or farm, but could
follow the bent of my genius, which is a very crooked one, every moment. Beside
being better off than they already, if my house had been burned or my crops had
failed, I should have been nearly as well off as before.
</p>

<p>
I am wont to think that men are not so much the keepers of herds as herds are
the keepers of men, the former are so much the freer. Men and oxen exchange
work; but if we consider necessary work only, the oxen will be seen to have
greatly the advantage, their farm is so much the larger. Man does some of his
part of the exchange work in his six weeks of haying, and it is no boy&rsquo;s
play. Certainly no nation that lived simply in all respects, that is, no nation
of philosophers, would commit so great a blunder as to use the labor of
animals. True, there never was and is not likely soon to be a nation of
philosophers, nor am I certain it is desirable that there should be. However,
<i>I</i> should never have broken a horse or bull and taken him to board for
any work he might do for me, for fear I should become a horse-man or a
herds-man merely; and if society seems to be the gainer by so doing, are we
certain that what is one man&rsquo;s gain is not another&rsquo;s loss, and that
the stable-boy has equal cause with his master to be satisfied? Granted that
some public works would not have been constructed without this aid, and let man
share the glory of such with the ox and horse; does it follow that he could not
have accomplished works yet more worthy of himself in that case? When men begin
to do, not merely unnecessary or artistic, but luxurious and idle work, with
their assistance, it is inevitable that a few do all the exchange work with the
oxen, or, in other words, become the slaves of the strongest. Man thus not only
works for the animal within him, but, for a symbol of this, he works for the
animal without him. Though we have many substantial houses of brick or stone,
the prosperity of the farmer is still measured by the degree to which the barn
overshadows the house. This town is said to have the largest houses for oxen,
cows, and horses hereabouts, and it is not behindhand in its public buildings;
but there are very few halls for free worship or free speech in this county. It
should not be by their architecture, but why not even by their power of
abstract thought, that nations should seek to commemorate themselves? How much
more admirable the Bhagvat-Geeta than all the ruins of the East! Towers and
temples are the luxury of princes. A simple and independent mind does not toil
at the bidding of any prince. Genius is not a retainer to any emperor, nor is
its material silver, or gold, or marble, except to a trifling extent. To what
end, pray, is so much stone hammered? In Arcadia, when I was there, I did not
see any hammering stone. Nations are possessed with an insane ambition to
perpetuate the memory of themselves by the amount of hammered stone they leave.
What if equal pains were taken to smooth and polish their manners? One piece of
good sense would be more memorable than a monument as high as the moon. I love
better to see stones in place. The grandeur of Thebes was a vulgar grandeur.
More sensible is a rod of stone wall that bounds an honest man&rsquo;s field
than a hundred-gated Thebes that has wandered farther from the true end of
life. The religion and civilization which are barbaric and heathenish build
splendid temples; but what you might call Christianity does not. Most of the
stone a nation hammers goes toward its tomb only. It buries itself alive. As
for the Pyramids, there is nothing to wonder at in them so much as the fact
that so many men could be found degraded enough to spend their lives
constructing a tomb for some ambitious booby, whom it would have been wiser and
manlier to have drowned in the Nile, and then given his body to the dogs. I
might possibly invent some excuse for them and him, but I have no time for it.
As for the religion and love of art of the builders, it is much the same all
the world over, whether the building be an Egyptian temple or the United States
Bank. It costs more than it comes to. The mainspring is vanity, assisted by the
love of garlic and bread and butter. Mr. Balcom, a promising young architect,
designs it on the back of his Vitruvius, with hard pencil and ruler, and the
job is let out to Dobson &amp; Sons, stonecutters. When the thirty centuries
begin to look down on it, mankind begin to look up at it. As for your high
towers and monuments, there was a crazy fellow once in this town who undertook
to dig through to China, and he got so far that, as he said, he heard the
Chinese pots and kettles rattle; but I think that I shall not go out of my way
to admire the hole which he made. Many are concerned about the monuments of the
West and the East,&mdash;to know who built them. For my part, I should like to
know who in those days did not build them,&mdash;who were above such trifling.
But to proceed with my statistics.

By surveying, carpentry, and day-labor of various other kinds in the village in
the mean while, for I have as many trades as fingers, I had earned $13.34. The

Yes, I did eat $8.74, all told; but I should not thus unblushingly publish my
guilt, if I did not know that most of my readers were equally guilty with
myself, and that their deeds would look no better in print. The next year I
sometimes caught a mess of fish for my dinner, and once I went so far as to
slaughter a woodchuck which ravaged my bean-field,&mdash;effect his
transmigration, as a Tartar would say,&mdash;and devour him, partly for
experiment&rsquo;s sake; but though it afforded me a momentary enjoyment,
notwithstanding a musky flavor, I saw that the longest use would not make that
a good practice, however it might seem to have your woodchucks ready dressed by
the village butcher.

</p>

<p>
These statistics, however accidental and therefore uninstructive they may
appear, as they have a certain completeness, have a certain value also. Nothing
was given me of which I have not rendered some account. It appears from the
above estimate, that my food alone cost me in money about twenty-seven cents a
week. It was, for nearly two years after this, rye and Indian meal without
yeast, potatoes, rice, a very little salt pork, molasses, and salt, and my
drink water. It was fit that I should live on rice, mainly, who loved so well
the philosophy of India. To meet the objections of some inveterate cavillers, I
may as well state, that if I dined out occasionally, as I always had done, and
I trust shall have opportunities to do again, it was frequently to the
detriment of my domestic arrangements. But the dining out, being, as I have
stated, a constant element, does not in the least affect a comparative
statement like this.
</p>

<p>
I learned from my two years&rsquo; experience that it would cost incredibly
little trouble to obtain one&rsquo;s necessary food, even in this latitude;
that a man may use as simple a diet as the animals, and yet retain health and
strength. I have made a satisfactory dinner, satisfactory on several accounts,
simply off a dish of purslane (<i>Portulaca oleracea</i>) which I gathered in
my cornfield, boiled and salted. I give the Latin on account of the savoriness
of the trivial name. And pray what more can a reasonable man desire, in
peaceful times, in ordinary noons, than a sufficient number of ears of green
sweet-corn boiled, with the addition of salt? Even the little variety which I
used was a yielding to the demands of appetite, and not of health. Yet men have
come to such a pass that they frequently starve, not for want of necessaries,
but for want of luxuries; and I know a good woman who thinks that her son lost
his life because he took to drinking water only.
</p>

<p>
The reader will perceive that I am treating the subject rather from an economic
than a dietetic point of view, and he will not venture to put my abstemiousness
to the test unless he has a well-stocked larder.
</p>

<p>
Bread I at first made of pure Indian meal and salt, genuine hoe-cakes, which I
baked before my fire out of doors on a shingle or the end of a stick of timber
sawed off in building my house; but it was wont to get smoked and to have a
piny flavor. I tried flour also; but have at last found a mixture of rye and
Indian meal most convenient and agreeable. In cold weather it was no little
amusement to bake several small loaves of this in succession, tending and
turning them as carefully as an Egyptian his hatching eggs. They were a real
cereal fruit which I ripened, and they had to my senses a fragrance like that
of other noble fruits, which I kept in as long as possible by wrapping them in
cloths. I made a study of the ancient and indispensable art of bread-making,
consulting such authorities as offered, going back to the primitive days and
first invention of the unleavened kind, when from the wildness of nuts and
meats men first reached the mildness and refinement of this diet, and
travelling gradually down in my studies through that accidental souring of the
dough which, it is supposed, taught the leavening process, and through the
various fermentations thereafter, till I came to &ldquo;good, sweet, wholesome
bread,&rdquo; the staff of life. Leaven, which some deem the soul of bread, the
<i>spiritus</i> which fills its cellular tissue, which is religiously preserved
like the vestal fire,&mdash;some precious bottle-full, I suppose, first brought
over in the Mayflower, did the business for America, and its influence is still
rising, swelling, spreading, in cerealian billows over the land,&mdash;this seed
I regularly and faithfully procured from the village, till at length one
morning I forgot the rules, and scalded my yeast; by which accident I
discovered that even this was not indispensable,&mdash;for my discoveries were
not by the synthetic but analytic process,&mdash;and I have gladly omitted it
since, though most housewives earnestly assured me that safe and wholesome
bread without yeast might not be, and elderly people prophesied a speedy decay
of the vital forces. Yet I find it not to be an essential ingredient, and after
going without it for a year am still in the land of the living; and I am glad
to escape the trivialness of carrying a bottle-full in my pocket, which would
sometimes pop and discharge its contents to my discomfiture. It is simpler and
more respectable to omit it. Man is an animal who more than any other can adapt
himself to all climates and circumstances. Neither did I put any sal soda, or
other acid or alkali, into my bread. It would seem that I made it according to
the recipe which Marcus Porcius Cato gave about two centuries before Christ.
&ldquo;Panem depsticium sic facito. Manus mortariumque bene lavato. Farinam in
mortarium indito, aqu√¶ paulatim addito, subigitoque pulchre. Ubi bene
subegeris, defingito, coquitoque sub testu.&rdquo; Which I take to
mean&mdash;&ldquo;Make kneaded bread thus. Wash your hands and trough well.
Put the meal into the trough, add water gradually, and knead it thoroughly.
When you have kneaded it well, mould it, and bake it under a cover,&rdquo; that
is, in a baking-kettle. Not a word about leaven. But I did not always use this
staff of life. At one time, owing to the emptiness of my purse, I saw none of
it for more than a month.
</p>

<p>
Every New Englander might easily raise all his own breadstuffs in this land of
rye and Indian corn, and not depend on distant and fluctuating markets for
them. Yet so far are we from simplicity and independence that, in Concord,
fresh and sweet meal is rarely sold in the shops, and hominy and corn in a
still coarser form are hardly used by any. For the most part the farmer gives
to his cattle and hogs the grain of his own producing, and buys flour, which is
at least no more wholesome, at a greater cost, at the store. I saw that I could
easily raise my bushel or two of rye and Indian corn, for the former will grow
on the poorest land, and the latter does not require the best, and grind them
in a hand-mill, and so do without rice and pork; and if I must have some
concentrated sweet, I found by experiment that I could make a very good
molasses either of pumpkins or beets, and I knew that I needed only to set out
a few maples to obtain it more easily still, and while these were growing I
could use various substitutes beside those which I have named.
&ldquo;For,&rdquo; as the Forefathers sang,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;we can make liquor to sweeten our lips<br />
Of pumpkins and parsnips and walnut-tree chips.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
Finally, as for salt, that grossest of groceries, to obtain this might be a fit
occasion for a visit to the seashore, or, if I did without it altogether, I
should probably drink the less water. I do not learn that the Indians ever
troubled themselves to go after it.
</p>

<p>
Thus I could avoid all trade and barter, so far as my food was concerned, and
having a shelter already, it would only remain to get clothing and fuel. The
pantaloons which I now wear were woven in a farmer&rsquo;s family,&mdash;thank
Heaven there is so much virtue still in man; for I think the fall from the
farmer to the operative as great and memorable as that from the man to the
farmer;&mdash;and in a new country, fuel is an encumbrance. As for a habitat,
if I were not permitted still to squat, I might purchase one acre at the same
price for which the land I cultivated was sold&mdash;namely, eight dollars and
eight cents. But as it was, I considered that I enhanced the value of the land
by squatting on it.
</p>

<p>
There is a certain class of unbelievers who sometimes ask me such questions as,
if I think that I can live on vegetable food alone; and to strike at the root
of the matter at once,&mdash;for the root is faith,&mdash;I am accustomed to
answer such, that I can live on board nails. If they cannot understand that,
they cannot understand much that I have to say. For my part, I am glad to hear
of experiments of this kind being tried; as that a young man tried for a
fortnight to live on hard, raw corn on the ear, using his teeth for all mortar.
The squirrel tribe tried the same and succeeded. The human race is interested
in these experiments, though a few old women who are incapacitated for them, or
who own their thirds in mills, may be alarmed.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
My furniture, part of which I made myself, and the rest cost me nothing of
which I have not rendered an account, consisted of a bed, a table, a desk,
three chairs, a looking-glass three inches in diameter, a pair of tongs and
andirons, a kettle, a skillet, and a frying-pan, a dipper, a wash-bowl, two
knives and forks, three plates, one cup, one spoon, a jug for oil, a jug for
molasses, and a japanned lamp. None is so poor that he need sit on a pumpkin.
That is shiftlessness. There is a plenty of such chairs as I like best in the
village garrets to be had for taking them away. Furniture! Thank God, I can sit
and I can stand without the aid of a furniture warehouse. What man but a
philosopher would not be ashamed to see his furniture packed in a cart and
going up country exposed to the light of heaven and the eyes of men, a beggarly
account of empty boxes? That is Spaulding&rsquo;s furniture. I could never tell
from inspecting such a load whether it belonged to a so called rich man or a
poor one; the owner always seemed poverty-stricken. Indeed, the more you have
of such things the poorer you are. Each load looks as if it contained the
contents of a dozen shanties; and if one shanty is poor, this is a dozen times
as poor. Pray, for what do we <i>move</i> ever but to get rid of our furniture,
our <i>exuvi√¶</i>; at last to go from this world to another newly
furnished, and leave this to be burned? It is the same as if all these traps
were buckled to a man&rsquo;s belt, and he could not move over the rough
country where our lines are cast without dragging them,&mdash;dragging his trap.
He was a lucky fox that left his tail in the trap. The muskrat will gnaw his
third leg off to be free. No wonder man has lost his elasticity. How often he
is at a dead set! &ldquo;Sir, if I may be so bold, what do you mean by a dead
set?&rdquo; If you are a seer, whenever you meet a man you will see all that he
owns, ay, and much that he pretends to disown, behind him, even to his kitchen
furniture and all the trumpery which he saves and will not burn, and he will
appear to be harnessed to it and making what headway he can. I think that the
man is at a dead set who has got through a knot hole or gateway where his
sledge load of furniture cannot follow him. I cannot but feel compassion when I
hear some trig, compact-looking man, seemingly free, all girded and ready,
speak of his &ldquo;furniture,&rdquo; as whether it is insured or not.
&ldquo;But what shall I do with my furniture?&rdquo; My gay butterfly is
entangled in a spider&rsquo;s web then. Even those who seem for a long while
not to have any, if you inquire more narrowly you will find have some stored in
somebody&rsquo;s barn. I look upon England to-day as an old gentleman who is
travelling with a great deal of baggage, trumpery which has accumulated from
long housekeeping, which he has not the courage to burn; great trunk, little
trunk, bandbox and bundle. Throw away the first three at least. It would
surpass the powers of a well man nowadays to take up his bed and walk, and I
should certainly advise a sick one to lay down his bed and run. When I have met
an immigrant tottering under a bundle which contained his all&mdash;looking
like an enormous wen which had grown out of the nape of his neck&mdash;I have
pitied him, not because that was his all, but because he had all <i>that</i> to
carry. If I have got to drag my trap, I will take care that it be a light one
and do not nip me in a vital part. But perchance it would be wisest never to
put one&rsquo;s paw into it.

I would observe, by the way, that it costs me nothing for curtains, for I have
no gazers to shut out but the sun and moon, and I am willing that they should
look in. The moon will not sour milk nor taint meat of mine, nor will the sun
injure my furniture or fade my carpet, and if he is sometimes too warm a
friend, I find it still better economy to retreat behind some curtain which
nature has provided, than to add a single item to the details of housekeeping.
A lady once offered me a mat, but as I had no room to spare within the house,
nor time to spare within or without to shake it, I declined it, preferring to
wipe my feet on the sod before my door. It is best to avoid the beginnings of
evil.

Not long since I was present at the auction of a deacon&rsquo;s effects, for
his life had not been ineffectual:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;The evil that men do lives after them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="noindent">
As usual, a great proportion was trumpery which had begun to accumulate in his
father&rsquo;s day. Among the rest was a dried tapeworm. And now, after lying
half a century in his garret and other dust holes, these things were not
burned; instead of a <i>bonfire</i>, or purifying destruction of them, there
was an <i>auction</i>, or increasing of them. The neighbors eagerly collected
to view them, bought them all, and carefully transported them to their garrets
and dust holes, to lie there till their estates are settled, when they will
start again. When a man dies he kicks the dust.
</p>

<p>
The customs of some savage nations might, perchance, be profitably imitated by
us, for they at least go through the semblance of casting their slough
annually; they have the idea of the thing, whether they have the reality or
not. Would it not be well if we were to celebrate such a &ldquo;busk,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;feast of first fruits,&rdquo; as Bartram describes to have been the
custom of the Mucclasse Indians? &ldquo;When a town celebrates the busk,&rdquo;
says he, &ldquo;having previously provided themselves with new clothes, new
pots, pans, and other household utensils and furniture, they collect all their
worn out clothes and other despicable things, sweep and cleanse their houses,
squares, and the whole town of their filth, which with all the remaining grain
and other old provisions they cast together into one common heap, and consume
it with fire. After having taken medicine, and fasted for three days, all the
fire in the town is extinguished. During this fast they abstain from the
gratification of every appetite and passion whatever. A general amnesty is
proclaimed; all malefactors may return to their town.&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the fourth morning, the high priest, by rubbing dry wood together,
produces new fire in the public square, from whence every habitation in the
town is supplied with the new and pure flame.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They then feast on the new corn and fruits, and dance and sing for three days,
&ldquo;and the four following days they receive visits and rejoice with their
friends from neighboring towns who have in like manner purified and prepared
themselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Mexicans also practised a similar purification at the end of every
fifty-two years, in the belief that it was time for the world to come to an
end.
</p>

<p>
I have scarcely heard of a truer sacrament, that is, as the dictionary defines
it, &ldquo;outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace,&rdquo;
than this, and I have no doubt that they were originally inspired directly from
Heaven to do thus, though they have no biblical record of the revelation.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
For more than five years I maintained myself thus solely by the labor of my
hands, and I found, that by working about six weeks in a year, I could meet all
the expenses of living. The whole of my winters, as well as most of my summers,
I had free and clear for study. I have thoroughly tried school-keeping, and
found that my expenses were in proportion, or rather out of proportion, to my
income, for I was obliged to dress and train, not to say think and believe,
accordingly, and I lost my time into the bargain. As I did not teach for the
good of my fellow-men, but simply for a livelihood, this was a failure. I have
tried trade; but I found that it would take ten years to get under way in that,
and that then I should probably be on my way to the devil. I was actually
afraid that I might by that time be doing what is called a good business. When
formerly I was looking about to see what I could do for a living, some sad
experience in conforming to the wishes of friends being fresh in my mind to tax
my ingenuity, I thought often and seriously of picking huckleberries; that
surely I could do, and its small profits might suffice,&mdash;for my greatest
skill has been to want but little,&mdash;so little capital it required, so
little distraction from my wonted moods, I foolishly thought. While my
acquaintances went unhesitatingly into trade or the professions, I contemplated
this occupation as most like theirs; ranging the hills all summer to pick the
berries which came in my way, and thereafter carelessly dispose of them; so, to
keep the flocks of Admetus. I also dreamed that I might gather the wild herbs,
or carry evergreens to such villagers as loved to be reminded of the woods,
even to the city, by hay-cart loads. But I have since learned that trade curses
everything it handles; and though you trade in messages from heaven, the whole
curse of trade attaches to the business.
</p>

<p>
As I preferred some things to others, and especially valued my freedom, as I
could fare hard and yet succeed well, I did not wish to spend my time in
earning rich carpets or other fine furniture, or delicate cookery, or a house
in the Grecian or the Gothic style just yet. If there are any to whom it is no
interruption to acquire these things, and who know how to use them when
acquired, I relinquish to them the pursuit. Some are &ldquo;industrious,&rdquo;
and appear to love labor for its own sake, or perhaps because it keeps them out
of worse mischief; to such I have at present nothing to say. Those who would
not know what to do with more leisure than they now enjoy, I might advise to
work twice as hard as they do,&mdash;work till they pay for themselves, and get
their free papers. For myself I found that the occupation of a day-laborer was
the most independent of any, especially as it required only thirty or forty
days in a year to support one. The laborer&rsquo;s day ends with the going down
of the sun, and he is then free to devote himself to his chosen pursuit,
independent of his labor; but his employer, who speculates from month to month,
has no respite from one end of the year to the other.
</p>

<p>
In short, I am convinced, both by faith and experience, that to maintain
one&rsquo;s self on this earth is not a hardship but a pastime, if we will live
simply and wisely; as the pursuits of the simpler nations are still the sports
of the more artificial. It is not necessary that a man should earn his living
by the sweat of his brow, unless he sweats easier than I do.
</p>

<p>
One young man of my acquaintance, who has inherited some acres, told me that he
thought he should live as I did, <i>if he had the means</i>. I would not have
any one adopt <i>my</i> mode of living on any account; for, beside that before
he has fairly learned it I may have found out another for myself, I desire that
there may be as many different persons in the world as possible; but I would
have each one be very careful to find out and pursue <i>his own</i> way, and
not his father&rsquo;s or his mother&rsquo;s or his neighbor&rsquo;s instead.
The youth may build or plant or sail, only let him not be hindered from doing
that which he tells me he would like to do. It is by a mathematical point only
that we are wise, as the sailor or the fugitive slave keeps the polestar in his
eye; but that is sufficient guidance for all our life. We may not arrive at our
port within a calculable period, but we would preserve the true course.
</p>

<p>
Undoubtedly, in this case, what is true for one is truer still for a thousand,
as a large house is not proportionally more expensive than a small one, since
one roof may cover, one cellar underlie, and one wall separate several
apartments. But for my part, I preferred the solitary dwelling. Moreover, it
will commonly be cheaper to build the whole yourself than to convince another
of the advantage of the common wall; and when you have done this, the common
partition, to be much cheaper, must be a thin one, and that other may prove a
bad neighbor, and also not keep his side in repair. The only co√∂peration which
is commonly possible is exceedingly partial and superficial; and what little
true co√∂peration there is, is as if it were not, being a harmony inaudible to
men. If a man has faith, he will co√∂perate with equal faith everywhere; if he
has not faith, he will continue to live like the rest of the world, whatever
company he is joined to. To co√∂perate, in the highest as well as the lowest
sense, means <i>to get our living together</i>. I heard it proposed lately that
two young men should travel together over the world, the one without money,
earning his means as he went, before the mast and behind the plow, the other
carrying a bill of exchange in his pocket. It was easy to see that they could
not long be companions or co√∂perate, since one would not <i>operate</i> at
all. They would part at the first interesting crisis in their adventures. Above
all, as I have implied, the man who goes alone can start to-day; but he who
travels with another must wait till that other is ready, and it may be a long
time before they get off.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
But all this is very selfish, I have heard some of my townsmen say. I confess
that I have hitherto indulged very little in philanthropic enterprises. I have
made some sacrifices to a sense of duty, and among others have sacrificed this
pleasure also. There are those who have used all their arts to persuade me to
undertake the support of some poor family in the town; and if I had nothing to
do,&mdash;for the devil finds employment for the idle,&mdash;I might try my hand
at some such pastime as that. However, when I have thought to indulge myself in
this respect, and lay their Heaven under an obligation by maintaining certain
poor persons in all respects as comfortably as I maintain myself, and have even
ventured so far as to make them the offer, they have one and all unhesitatingly
preferred to remain poor. While my townsmen and women are devoted in so many
ways to the good of their fellows, I trust that one at least may be spared to
other and less humane pursuits. You must have a genius for charity as well as
for any thing else. As for Doing-good, that is one of the professions which are
full. Moreover, I have tried it fairly, and, strange as it may seem, am
satisfied that it does not agree with my constitution. Probably I should not
consciously and deliberately forsake my particular calling to do the good which
society demands of me, to save the universe from annihilation; and I believe
that a like but infinitely greater steadfastness elsewhere is all that now
preserves it. But I would not stand between any man and his genius; and to him
who does this work, which I decline, with his whole heart and soul and life, I
would say, Persevere, even if the world call it doing evil, as it is most
likely they will.
</p>

<p>
I am far from supposing that my case is a peculiar one; no doubt many of my
readers would make a similar defence. At doing something,&mdash;I will not
engage that my neighbors shall pronounce it good,&mdash;I do not hesitate to say
that I should be a capital fellow to hire; but what that is, it is for my
employer to find out. What <i>good</i> I do, in the common sense of that word,
must be aside from my main path, and for the most part wholly unintended. Men
say, practically, Begin where you are and such as you are, without aiming
mainly to become of more worth, and with kindness aforethought go about doing
good. If I were to preach at all in this strain, I should say rather, Set about
being good. As if the sun should stop when he had kindled his fires up to the
splendor of a moon or a star of the sixth magnitude, and go about like a Robin
Goodfellow, peeping in at every cottage window, inspiring lunatics, and
tainting meats, and making darkness visible, instead of steadily increasing his
genial heat and beneficence till he is of such brightness that no mortal can
look him in the face, and then, and in the mean while too, going about the world
in his own orbit, doing it good, or rather, as a truer philosophy has
discovered, the world going about him getting good. When Phaeton, wishing to
prove his heavenly birth by his beneficence, had the sun&rsquo;s chariot but
one day, and drove out of the beaten track, he burned several blocks of houses
in the lower streets of heaven, and scorched the surface of the earth, and
dried up every spring, and made the great desert of Sahara, till at length
Jupiter hurled him headlong to the earth with a thunderbolt, and the sun,
through grief at his death, did not shine for a year.
</p>

<p>
There is no odor so bad as that which arises from goodness tainted. It is
human, it is divine, carrion. If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming
to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my
life, as from that dry and parching wind of the African deserts called the
simoom, which fills the mouth and nose and ears and eyes with dust till you are
suffocated, for fear that I should get some of his good done to me,&mdash;some
of its virus mingled with my blood. No,&mdash;in this case I would rather
suffer evil the natural way. A man is not a good <i>man</i> to me because he
will feed me if I should be starving, or warm me if I should be freezing, or
pull me out of a ditch if I should ever fall into one. I can find you a
Newfoundland dog that will do as much. Philanthropy is not love for one&rsquo;s
fellow-man in the broadest sense. Howard was no doubt an exceedingly kind and
worthy man in his way, and has his reward; but, comparatively speaking, what
are a hundred Howards to <i>us</i>, if their philanthropy do not help <i>us</i>
in our best estate, when we are most worthy to be helped? I never heard of a
philanthropic meeting in which it was sincerely proposed to do any good to me,
or the like of me.
</p>

<p>
The Jesuits were quite balked by those Indians who, being burned at the stake,
suggested new modes of torture to their tormentors. Being superior to physical
suffering, it sometimes chanced that they were superior to any consolation
which the missionaries could offer; and the law to do as you would be done by
fell with less persuasiveness on the ears of those who, for their part, did not
care how they were done by, who loved their enemies after a new fashion, and
came very near freely forgiving them all they did.
</p>

<p>
Be sure that you give the poor the aid they most need, though it be your
example which leaves them far behind. If you give money, spend yourself with
it, and do not merely abandon it to them. We make curious mistakes sometimes.
Often the poor man is not so cold and hungry as he is dirty and ragged and
gross. It is partly his taste, and not merely his misfortune. If you give him
money, he will perhaps buy more rags with it. I was wont to pity the clumsy
Irish laborers who cut ice on the pond, in such mean and ragged clothes, while
I shivered in my more tidy and somewhat more fashionable garments, till, one
bitter cold day, one who had slipped into the water came to my house to warm
him, and I saw him strip off three pairs of pants and two pairs of stockings
ere he got down to the skin, though they were dirty and ragged enough, it is
true, and that he could afford to refuse the <i>extra</i> garments which I
offered him, he had so many <i>intra</i> ones. This ducking was the very thing
he needed. Then I began to pity myself, and I saw that it would be a greater
charity to bestow on me a flannel shirt than a whole slop-shop on him. There
are a thousand hacking at the branches of evil to one who is striking at the
root, and it may be that he who bestows the largest amount of time and money on
the needy is doing the most by his mode of life to produce that misery which he
strives in vain to relieve. It is the pious slave-breeder devoting the proceeds
of every tenth slave to buy a Sunday&rsquo;s liberty for the rest. Some show
their kindness to the poor by employing them in their kitchens. Would they not
be kinder if they employed themselves there? You boast of spending a tenth part
of your income in charity; maybe you should spend the nine tenths so, and done
with it. Society recovers only a tenth part of the property then. Is this owing
to the generosity of him in whose possession it is found, or to the remissness
of the officers of justice?
</p>

<p>
Philanthropy is almost the only virtue which is sufficiently appreciated by
mankind. Nay, it is greatly overrated; and it is our selfishness which
overrates it. A robust poor man, one sunny day here in Concord, praised a
fellow-townsman to me, because, as he said, he was kind to the poor; meaning
himself. The kind uncles and aunts of the race are more esteemed than its true
spiritual fathers and mothers. I once heard a reverend lecturer on England, a
man of learning and intelligence, after enumerating her scientific, literary,
and political worthies, Shakespeare, Bacon, Cromwell, Milton, Newton, and
others, speak next of her Christian heroes, whom, as if his profession required
it of him, he elevated to a place far above all the rest, as the greatest of
the great. They were Penn, Howard, and Mrs. Fry. Every one must feel the
falsehood and cant of this. The last were not England&rsquo;s best men and
women; only, perhaps, her best philanthropists.
</p>

<p>
I would not subtract any thing from the praise that is due to philanthropy, but
merely demand justice for all who by their lives and works are a blessing to
mankind. I do not value chiefly a man&rsquo;s uprightness and benevolence,
which are, as it were, his stem and leaves. Those plants of whose greenness
withered we make herb tea for the sick, serve but a humble use, and are most
employed by quacks. I want the flower and fruit of a man; that some fragrance
be wafted over from him to me, and some ripeness flavor our intercourse. His
goodness must not be a partial and transitory act, but a constant superfluity,
which costs him nothing and of which he is unconscious. This is a charity that
hides a multitude of sins. The philanthropist too often surrounds mankind with
the remembrance of his own cast-off griefs as an atmosphere, and calls it
sympathy. We should impart our courage, and not our despair, our health and
ease, and not our disease, and take care that this does not spread by
contagion. From what southern plains comes up the voice of wailing? Under what
latitudes reside the heathen to whom we would send light? Who is that
intemperate and brutal man whom we would redeem? If any thing ail a man, so that
he does not perform his functions, if he have a pain in his bowels
even,&mdash;for that is the seat of sympathy,&mdash;he forthwith sets about
reforming&mdash;the world. Being a microcosm himself, he discovers, and it
is a true discovery, and he is the man to make it,&mdash;that the world has been
eating green apples; to his eyes, in fact, the globe itself is a great green
apple, which there is danger awful to think of that the children of men will
nibble before it is ripe; and straightway his drastic philanthropy seeks out
the Esquimaux and the Patagonian, and embraces the populous Indian and Chinese
villages; and thus, by a few years of philanthropic activity, the powers in the
mean while using him for their own ends, no doubt, he cures himself of his
dyspepsia, the globe acquires a faint blush on one or both of its cheeks, as if
it were beginning to be ripe, and life loses its crudity and is once more sweet
and wholesome to live. I never dreamed of any enormity greater than I have
committed. I never knew, and never shall know, a worse man than myself.
</p>

<p>
I believe that what so saddens the reformer is not his sympathy with his
fellows in distress, but, though he be the holiest son of God, is his private
ail. Let this be righted, let the spring come to him, the morning rise over his
couch, and he will forsake his generous companions without apology. My excuse
for not lecturing against the use of tobacco is, that I never chewed it; that
is a penalty which reformed tobacco-chewers have to pay; though there are
things enough I have chewed, which I could lecture against. If you should ever
be betrayed into any of these philanthropies, do not let your left hand know
what your right hand does, for it is not worth knowing. Rescue the drowning and
tie your shoe-strings. Take your time, and set about some free labor.
</p>

<p>
Our manners have been corrupted by communication with the saints. Our
hymn-books resound with a melodious cursing of God and enduring him forever.
One would say that even the prophets and redeemers had rather consoled the
fears than confirmed the hopes of man. There is nowhere recorded a simple and
irrepressible satisfaction with the gift of life, any memorable praise of God.
All health and success does me good, however far off and withdrawn it may
appear; all disease and failure helps to make me sad and does me evil, however
much sympathy it may have with me or I with it. If, then, we would indeed
restore mankind by truly Indian, botanic, magnetic, or natural means, let us
first be as simple and well as Nature ourselves, dispel the clouds which hang
over our own brows, and take up a little life into our pores. Do not stay to be
an overseer of the poor, but endeavor to become one of the worthies of the
world.
</p>

<p>
I read in the Gulistan, or Flower Garden, of Sheik Sadi of Shiraz, that
&ldquo;They asked a wise man, saying; Of the many celebrated trees which the
Most High God has created lofty and umbrageous, they call none azad, or free,
excepting the cypress, which bears no fruit; what mystery is there in this? He
replied; Each has its appropriate produce, and appointed season, during the
continuance of which it is fresh and blooming, and during their absence dry and
withered; to neither of which states is the cypress exposed, being always
flourishing; and of this nature are the azads, or religious
independents.&mdash;Fix not thy heart on that which is transitory; for the
Dijlah, or Tigris, will continue to flow through Bagdad after the race of
caliphs is extinct: if thy hand has plenty, be liberal as the date tree; but if
it affords nothing to give away, be an azad, or free man, like the
cypress.&rdquo;

<p><a name="chap03"></a></p> <h2>Where I Lived, and What I Lived For</h2>

<p>
At a certain season of our life we are accustomed to consider every spot as the
possible site of a house. I have thus surveyed the country on every side within
a dozen miles of where I live. In imagination I have bought all the farms in
succession, for all were to be bought, and I knew their price. I walked over
each farmer&rsquo;s premises, tasted his wild apples, discoursed on husbandry
with him, took his farm at his price, at any price, mortgaging it to him in my
mind; even put a higher price on it,&mdash;took everything but a deed of
it,&mdash;took his word for his deed, for I dearly love to talk,&mdash;cultivated
it, and him too to some extent, I trust, and withdrew when I had enjoyed it
long enough, leaving him to carry it on. This experience entitled me to be
regarded as a sort of real-estate broker by my friends. Wherever I sat, there I
might live, and the landscape radiated from me accordingly. What is a house but
a <i>sedes</i>, a seat?&mdash;better if a country seat. I discovered many a
site for a house not likely to be soon improved, which some might have thought
too far from the village, but to my eyes the village was too far from it. Well,
there I might live, I said; and there I did live, for an hour, a summer and a
winter life; saw how I could let the years run off, buffet the winter through,
and see the spring come in. The future inhabitants of this region, wherever
they may place their houses, may be sure that they have been anticipated. An
afternoon sufficed to lay out the land into orchard, woodlot, and pasture, and
to decide what fine oaks or pines should be left to stand before the door, and
whence each blasted tree could be seen to the best advantage; and then I let it
lie, fallow perchance, for a man is rich in proportion to the number of things
which he can afford to let alone.
</p>

<p>
My imagination carried me so far that I even had the refusal of several
farms,&mdash;the refusal was all I wanted,&mdash;but I never got my fingers
burned by actual possession. The nearest that I came to actual possession was
when I bought the Hollowell place, and had begun to sort my seeds, and
collected materials with which to make a wheelbarrow to carry it on or off
with; but before the owner gave me a deed of it, his wife&mdash;every man has
such a wife&mdash;changed her mind and wished to keep it, and he offered me ten
dollars to release him. Now, to speak the truth, I had but ten cents in the
world, and it surpassed my arithmetic to tell, if I was that man who had ten
cents, or who had a farm, or ten dollars, or all together. However, I let him
keep the ten dollars and the farm too, for I had carried it far enough; or
rather, to be generous, I sold him the farm for just what I gave for it, and,
as he was not a rich man, made him a present of ten dollars, and still had my
ten cents, and seeds, and materials for a wheelbarrow left. I found thus that I
had been a rich man without any damage to my poverty. But I retained the
landscape, and I have since annually carried off what it yielded without a
wheelbarrow. With respect to landscapes,&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;I am monarch of all I <i>survey</i>,<br />
My right there is none to dispute.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
I have frequently seen a poet withdraw, having enjoyed the most valuable part
of a farm, while the crusty farmer supposed that he had got a few wild apples
only. Why, the owner does not know it for many years when a poet has put his
farm in rhyme, the most admirable kind of invisible fence, has fairly impounded
it, milked it, skimmed it, and got all the cream, and left the farmer only the
skimmed milk.
</p>

<p>
The real attractions of the Hollowell farm, to me, were; its complete
retirement, being, about two miles from the village, half a mile from the
nearest neighbor, and separated from the highway by a broad field; its bounding
on the river, which the owner said protected it by its fogs from frosts in the
spring, though that was nothing to me; the gray color and ruinous state of the
house and barn, and the dilapidated fences, which put such an interval between
me and the last occupant; the hollow and lichen-covered apple trees, gnawed by
rabbits, showing what kind of neighbors I should have; but above all, the
recollection I had of it from my earliest voyages up the river, when the house
was concealed behind a dense grove of red maples, through which I heard the
house-dog bark. I was in haste to buy it, before the proprietor finished
getting out some rocks, cutting down the hollow apple trees, and grubbing up
some young birches which had sprung up in the pasture, or, in short, had made
any more of his improvements. To enjoy these advantages I was ready to carry it
on; like Atlas, to take the world on my shoulders,&mdash;I never heard what
compensation he received for that,&mdash;and do all those things which had no
other motive or excuse but that I might pay for it and be unmolested in my
possession of it; for I knew all the while that it would yield the most
abundant crop of the kind I wanted if I could only afford to let it alone. But
it turned out as I have said.
</p>

<p>
All that I could say, then, with respect to farming on a large scale, (I have
always cultivated a garden,) was, that I had had my seeds ready. Many think
that seeds improve with age. I have no doubt that time discriminates between
the good and the bad; and when at last I shall plant, I shall be less likely to
be disappointed. But I would say to my fellows, once for all, As long as
possible live free and uncommitted. It makes but little difference whether you
are committed to a farm or the county jail.
</p>

<p>
Old Cato, whose &ldquo;De Re Rustic√¢&rdquo; is my &ldquo;Cultivator,&rdquo;
says, and the only translation I have seen makes sheer nonsense of the
passage, &ldquo;When you think of getting a farm, turn it thus in your
mind, not to buy greedily; nor spare your pains to look at it, and do not think
it enough to go round it once. The oftener you go there the more it will please
you, if it is good.&rdquo; I think I shall not buy greedily, but go round and
round it as long as I live, and be buried in it first, that it may please me
the more at last.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
The present was my next experiment of this kind, which I purpose to describe
more at length; for convenience, putting the experience of two years into one.
As I have said, I do not propose to write an ode to dejection, but to brag as
lustily as chanticleer in the morning, standing on his roost, if only to wake
my neighbors up.
</p>

<p>
When first I took up my abode in the woods, that is, began to spend my nights
as well as days there, which, by accident, was on Independence Day, or the
Fourth of July, 1845, my house was not finished for winter, but was merely a
defence against the rain, without plastering or chimney, the walls being of
rough, weather-stained boards, with wide chinks, which made it cool at night.
The upright white hewn studs and freshly planed door and window casings gave it
a clean and airy look, especially in the morning, when its timbers were
saturated with dew, so that I fancied that by noon some sweet gum would exude
from them. To my imagination it retained throughout the day more or less of
this auroral character, reminding me of a certain house on a mountain which I
had visited the year before. This was an airy and unplastered cabin, fit to
entertain a travelling god, and where a goddess might trail her garments. The
winds which passed over my dwelling were such as sweep over the ridges of
mountains, bearing the broken strains, or celestial parts only, of terrestrial
music. The morning wind forever blows, the poem of creation is uninterrupted;
but few are the ears that hear it. Olympus is but the outside of the earth
every where.
</p>

<p>
The only house I had been the owner of before, if I except a boat, was a tent,
which I used occasionally when making excursions in the summer, and this is
still rolled up in my garret; but the boat, after passing from hand to hand,
has gone down the stream of time. With this more substantial shelter about me,
I had made some progress toward settling in the world. This frame, so slightly
clad, was a sort of crystallization around me, and reacted on the builder. It
was suggestive somewhat as a picture in outlines. I did not need to go outdoors
to take the air, for the atmosphere within had lost none of its freshness. It
was not so much within doors as behind a door where I sat, even in the rainiest
weather. The Harivansa says, &ldquo;An abode without birds is like a meat
without seasoning.&rdquo; Such was not my abode, for I found myself suddenly
neighbor to the birds; not by having imprisoned one, but having caged myself
near them. I was not only nearer to some of those which commonly frequent the
garden and the orchard, but to those wilder and more thrilling songsters of
the forest which never, or rarely, serenade a villager,&mdash;the wood-thrush,
the veery, the scarlet tanager, the field-sparrow, the whippoorwill, and many
others.
</p>

<p>
I was seated by the shore of a small pond, about a mile and a half south of the
village of Concord and somewhat higher than it, in the midst of an extensive
wood between that town and Lincoln, and about two miles south of that our only
field known to fame, Concord Battle Ground; but I was so low in the woods that
the opposite shore, half a mile off, like the rest, covered with wood, was my
most distant horizon. For the first week, whenever I looked out on the pond it
impressed me like a tarn high up on the side of a mountain, its bottom far
above the surface of other lakes, and, as the sun arose, I saw it throwing off
its nightly clothing of mist, and here and there, by degrees, its soft ripples
or its smooth reflecting surface was revealed, while the mists, like ghosts,
were stealthily withdrawing in every direction into the woods, as at the
breaking up of some nocturnal conventicle. The very dew seemed to hang upon the
trees later into the day than usual, as on the sides of mountains.
</p>

<p>
This small lake was of most value as a neighbor in the intervals of a gentle
rain storm in August, when, both air and water being perfectly still, but the
sky overcast, mid-afternoon had all the serenity of evening, and the
wood-thrush sang around, and was heard from shore to shore. A lake like this is
never smoother than at such a time; and the clear portion of the air above it
being shallow and darkened by clouds, the water, full of light and
reflections, becomes a lower heaven itself so much the more important. From a
hill top near by, where the wood had been recently cut off, there was a
pleasing vista southward across the pond, through a wide indentation in the
hills which form the shore there, where their opposite sides sloping toward
each other suggested a stream flowing out in that direction through a wooded
valley, but stream there was none. That way I looked between and over the near
green hills to some distant and higher ones in the horizon, tinged with blue.
Indeed, by standing on tiptoe I could catch a glimpse of some of the peaks of
the still bluer and more distant mountain ranges in the north-west, those
true-blue coins from heaven&rsquo;s own mint, and also of some portion of the
village. But in other directions, even from this point, I could not see over or
beyond the woods which surrounded me. It is well to have some water in your
neighborhood, to give buoyancy to and float the earth. One value even of the
smallest well is, that when you look into it you see that earth is not
continent but insular. This is as important as that it keeps butter cool. When
I looked across the pond from this peak toward the Sudbury meadows, which in
time of flood I distinguished elevated perhaps by a mirage in their seething
valley, like a coin in a basin, all the earth beyond the pond appeared like a
thin crust insulated and floated even by this small sheet of interverting
water, and I was reminded that this on which I dwelt was but <i>dry land</i>.
</p>

<p>
Though the view from my door was still more contracted, I did not feel crowded
or confined in the least. There was pasture enough for my imagination. The low
shrub-oak plateau to which the opposite shore arose, stretched away toward the
prairies of the West and the steppes of Tartary, affording ample room for all
the roving families of men. &ldquo;There are none happy in the world but beings
who enjoy freely a vast horizon,&rdquo;&mdash;said Damodara, when his herds
required new and larger pastures.
</p>

<p>
Both place and time were changed, and I dwelt nearer to those parts of the
universe and to those eras in history which had most attracted me. Where I
lived was as far off as many a region viewed nightly by astronomers. We are
wont to imagine rare and delectable places in some remote and more celestial
corner of the system, behind the constellation of Cassiopeia&rsquo;s Chair, far
from noise and disturbance. I discovered that my house actually had its site in
such a withdrawn, but forever new and unprofaned, part of the universe. If it
were worth the while to settle in those parts near to the Pleiades or the
Hyades, to Aldebaran or Altair, then I was really there, or at an equal
remoteness from the life which I had left behind, dwindled and twinkling with
as fine a ray to my nearest neighbor, and to be seen only in moonless nights by
him. Such was that part of creation where I had squatted;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;There was a shepherd that did live,<br />
    And held his thoughts as high<br />
As were the mounts whereon his flocks<br />
    Did hourly feed him by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
What should we think of the shepherd&rsquo;s life if his flocks always wandered
to higher pastures than his thoughts?
</p>

<p>
Every morning was a cheerful invitation to make my life of equal simplicity,
and I may say innocence, with Nature herself. I have been as sincere a
worshipper of Aurora as the Greeks. I got up early and bathed in the pond; that
was a religious exercise, and one of the best things which I did. They say that
characters were engraven on the bathing tub of king Tching-thang to this effect:
&ldquo;Renew thyself completely each day; do it again, and again, and forever
again.&rdquo; I can understand that. Morning brings back the heroic ages. I was
as much affected by the faint hum of a mosquito making its invisible and
unimaginable tour through my apartment at earliest dawn, when I was sitting
with door and windows open, as I could be by any trumpet that ever sang of
fame. It was Homer&rsquo;s requiem; itself an Iliad and Odyssey in the air,
singing its own wrath and wanderings. There was something cosmical about it; a
standing advertisement, till forbidden, of the everlasting vigor and fertility
of the world. The morning, which is the most memorable season of the day, is
the awakening hour. Then there is least somnolence in us; and for an hour, at
least, some part of us awakes which slumbers all the rest of the day and night.
Little is to be expected of that day, if it can be called a day, to which we
are not awakened by our Genius, but by the mechanical nudgings of some
servitor, are not awakened by our own newly-acquired force and aspirations from
within, accompanied by the undulations of celestial music, instead of factory
bells, and a fragrance filling the air&mdash;to a higher life than we fell
asleep from; and thus the darkness bear its fruit, and prove itself to be good,
no less than the light. That man who does not believe that each day contains an
earlier, more sacred, and auroral hour than he has yet profaned, has despaired
of life, and is pursuing a descending and darkening way. After a partial
cessation of his sensuous life, the soul of man, or its organs rather, are
reinvigorated each day, and his Genius tries again what noble life it can make.
All memorable events, I should say, transpire in morning time and in a morning
atmosphere. The Vedas say, &ldquo;All intelligences awake with the
morning.&rdquo; Poetry and art, and the fairest and most memorable of the
actions of men, date from such an hour. All poets and heroes, like Memnon, are
the children of Aurora, and emit their music at sunrise. To him whose elastic
and vigorous thought keeps pace with the sun, the day is a perpetual morning.
It matters not what the clocks say or the attitudes and labors of men. Morning
is when I am awake and there is a dawn in me. Moral reform is the effort to
throw off sleep. Why is it that men give so poor an account of their day if
they have not been slumbering? They are not such poor calculators. If they had
not been overcome with drowsiness, they would have performed something. The
millions are awake enough for physical labor; but only one in a million is
awake enough for effective intellectual exertion, only one in a hundred
millions to a poetic or divine life. To be awake is to be alive. I have never
yet met a man who was quite awake. How could I have looked him in the face?
</p>

<p>
We must learn to reawaken and keep ourselves awake, not by mechanical aids, but
by an infinite expectation of the dawn, which does not forsake us in our
soundest sleep. I know of no more encouraging fact than the unquestionable
ability of man to elevate his life by a conscious endeavor. It is something to
be able to paint a particular picture, or to carve a statue, and so to make a
few objects beautiful; but it is far more glorious to carve and paint the very
atmosphere and medium through which we look, which morally we can do. To affect
the quality of the day, that is the highest of arts. Every man is tasked to
make his life, even in its details, worthy of the contemplation of his most
elevated and critical hour. If we refused, or rather used up, such paltry
information as we get, the oracles would distinctly inform us how this might be
done.
</p>

<p>
I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the
essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and
not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived. I did not wish to live
what was not life, living is so dear; nor did I wish to practise resignation,
unless it was quite necessary. I wanted to live deep and suck out all the
marrow of life, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that
was not life, to cut a broad swath and shave close, to drive life into a
corner, and reduce it to its lowest terms, and, if it proved to be mean, why
then to get the whole and genuine meanness of it, and publish its meanness to
the world; or if it were sublime, to know it by experience, and be able to give
a true account of it in my next excursion. For most men, it appears to me, are
in a strange uncertainty about it, whether it is of the devil or of God, and
have <i>somewhat hastily</i> concluded that it is the chief end of man here to
&ldquo;glorify God and enjoy him forever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Still we live meanly, like ants; though the fable tells us that we were long
ago changed into men; like pygmies we fight with cranes; it is error upon
error, and clout upon clout, and our best virtue has for its occasion a
superfluous and evitable wretchedness. Our life is frittered away by detail. An
honest man has hardly need to count more than his ten fingers, or in extreme
cases he may add his ten toes, and lump the rest. Simplicity, simplicity,
simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a
thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on
your thumb nail. In the midst of this chopping sea of civilized life, such are
the clouds and storms and quicksands and thousand-and-one items to be allowed
for, that a man has to live, if he would not founder and go to the bottom and
not make his port at all, by dead reckoning, and he must be a great calculator
indeed who succeeds. Simplify, simplify. Instead of three meals a day, if it be
necessary eat but one; instead of a hundred dishes, five; and reduce other
things in proportion. Our life is like a German Confederacy, made up of petty
states, with its boundary forever fluctuating, so that even a German cannot
tell you how it is bounded at any moment. The nation itself, with all its
so called internal improvements, which, by the way are all external and
superficial, is just such an unwieldy and overgrown establishment, cluttered
with furniture and tripped up by its own traps, ruined by luxury and heedless
expense, by want of calculation and a worthy aim, as the million households in
the land; and the only cure for it as for them is in a rigid economy, a stern
and more than Spartan simplicity of life and elevation of purpose. It lives too
fast. Men think that it is essential that the <i>Nation</i> have commerce, and
export ice, and talk through a telegraph, and ride thirty miles an hour,
without a doubt, whether <i>they</i> do or not; but whether we should live like
baboons or like men, is a little uncertain. If we do not get out sleepers, and
forge rails, and devote days and nights to the work, but go to tinkering upon
our <i>lives</i> to improve <i>them</i>, who will build railroads? And if
railroads are not built, how shall we get to heaven in season? But if we stay
at home and mind our business, who will want railroads? We do not ride on the
railroad; it rides upon us. Did you ever think what those sleepers are that
underlie the railroad? Each one is a man, an Irish-man, or a Yankee man. The
rails are laid on them, and they are covered with sand, and the cars run
smoothly over them. They are sound sleepers, I assure you. And every few years
a new lot is laid down and run over; so that, if some have the pleasure of
riding on a rail, others have the misfortune to be ridden upon. And when they
run over a man that is walking in his sleep, a supernumerary sleeper in the
wrong position, and wake him up, they suddenly stop the cars, and make a hue
and cry about it, as if this were an exception. I am glad to know that it takes
a gang of men for every five miles to keep the sleepers down and level in their
beds as it is, for this is a sign that they may sometime get up again.
</p>

<p>
Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life? We are determined to be
starved before we are hungry. Men say that a stitch in time saves nine, and so
they take a thousand stitches to-day to save nine to-morrow. As for <i>work</i>,
we haven&rsquo;t any of any consequence. We have the Saint Vitus&rsquo; dance,
and cannot possibly keep our heads still. If I should only give a few pulls at
the parish bell-rope, as for a fire, that is, without setting the bell, there
is hardly a man on his farm in the outskirts of Concord, notwithstanding that
press of engagements which was his excuse so many times this morning, nor a
boy, nor a woman, I might almost say, but would forsake all and follow that
sound, not mainly to save property from the flames, but, if we will confess the
truth, much more to see it burn, since burn it must, and we, be it known, did
not set it on fire,&mdash;or to see it put out, and have a hand in it, if that
is done as handsomely; yes, even if it were the parish church itself. Hardly a
man takes a half hour&rsquo;s nap after dinner, but when he wakes he holds up
his head and asks, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the news?&rdquo; as if the rest of
mankind had stood his sentinels. Some give directions to be waked every
half hour, doubtless for no other purpose; and then, to pay for it, they tell
what they have dreamed. After a night&rsquo;s sleep the news is as
indispensable as the breakfast. &ldquo;Pray tell me any thing new that has
happened to a man any where on this globe,&rdquo;&mdash;and he reads it over his
coffee and rolls, that a man has had his eyes gouged out this morning on the
Wachito River; never dreaming the while that he lives in the dark unfathomed
mammoth cave of this world, and has but the rudiment of an eye himself.
</p>

<p>
For my part, I could easily do without the post-office. I think that there are
very few important communications made through it. To speak critically, I never
received more than one or two letters in my life&mdash;I wrote this some years
ago&mdash;that were worth the postage. The penny-post is, commonly, an
institution through which you seriously offer a man that penny for his thoughts
which is so often safely offered in jest. And I am sure that I never read any
memorable news in a newspaper. If we read of one man robbed, or murdered, or
killed by accident, or one house burned, or one vessel wrecked, or one
steamboat blown up, or one cow run over on the Western Railroad, or one mad dog
killed, or one lot of grasshoppers in the winter,&mdash;we never need read of
another. One is enough. If you are acquainted with the principle, what do you
care for a myriad instances and applications? To a philosopher all <i>news</i>,
as it is called, is gossip, and they who edit and read it are old women over
their tea. Yet not a few are greedy after this gossip. There was such a rush,
as I hear, the other day at one of the offices to learn the foreign news by the
last arrival, that several large squares of plate glass belonging to the
establishment were broken by the pressure,&mdash;news which I seriously think a
ready wit might write a twelve-month, or twelve years, beforehand with
sufficient accuracy. As for Spain, for instance, if you know how to throw in
Don Carlos and the Infanta, and Don Pedro and Seville and Granada, from time to
time in the right proportions,&mdash;they may have changed the names a little
since I saw the papers,&mdash;and serve up a bull-fight when other
entertainments fail, it will be true to the letter, and give us as good an idea
of the exact state or ruin of things in Spain as the most succinct and lucid
reports under this head in the newspapers: and as for England, almost the last
significant scrap of news from that quarter was the revolution of 1649; and if
you have learned the history of her crops for an average year, you never need
attend to that thing again, unless your speculations are of a merely pecuniary
character. If one may judge who rarely looks into the newspapers, nothing new
does ever happen in foreign parts, a French revolution not excepted.
</p>

<p>
What news! how much more important to know what that is which was never old!
&ldquo;Kieou-he-yu (great dignitary of the state of Wei) sent a man to
Khoung-tseu to know his news. Khoung-tseu caused the messenger to be seated
near him, and questioned him in these terms: What is your master doing? The
messenger answered with respect: My master desires to diminish the number of
his faults, but he cannot come to the end of them. The messenger being gone,
the philosopher remarked: What a worthy messenger! What a worthy
messenger!&rdquo; The preacher, instead of vexing the ears of drowsy farmers on
their day of rest at the end of the week,&mdash;for Sunday is the fit conclusion
of an ill-spent week, and not the fresh and brave beginning of a new
one,&mdash;with this one other draggle-tail of a sermon, should shout with
thundering voice, &ldquo;Pause! Avast! Why so seeming fast, but deadly
slow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Shams and delusions are esteemed for soundest truths, while reality is
fabulous. If men would steadily observe realities only, and not allow
themselves to be deluded, life, to compare it with such things as we know,
would be like a fairy tale and the Arabian Nights&rsquo; Entertainments. If we
respected only what is inevitable and has a right to be, music and poetry would
resound along the streets. When we are unhurried and wise, we perceive that
only great and worthy things have any permanent and absolute
existence,&mdash;that petty fears and petty pleasures are but the shadow of the
reality. This is always exhilarating and sublime. By closing the eyes and
slumbering, and consenting to be deceived by shows, men establish and confirm
their daily life of routine and habit everywhere, which still is built on
purely illusory foundations. Children, who play life, discern its true law and
relations more clearly than men, who fail to live it worthily, but who think
that they are wiser by experience, that is, by failure. I have read in a Hindoo
book, that &ldquo;there was a king&rsquo;s son, who, being expelled in infancy
from his native city, was brought up by a forester, and, growing up to maturity
in that state, imagined himself to belong to the barbarous race with which he
lived. One of his father&rsquo;s ministers having discovered him, revealed to
him what he was, and the misconception of his character was removed, and he
knew himself to be a prince. So soul,&rdquo; continues the Hindoo philosopher,
&ldquo;from the circumstances in which it is placed, mistakes its own
character, until the truth is revealed to it by some holy teacher, and then it
knows itself to be <i>Brahme</i>.&rdquo; I perceive that we inhabitants of New
England live this mean life that we do because our vision does not penetrate
the surface of things. We think that that <i>is</i> which <i>appears</i> to be.
If a man should walk through this town and see only the reality, where, think
you, would the &ldquo;Mill-dam&rdquo; go to? If he should give us an account of
the realities he beheld there, we should not recognize the place in his
description. Look at a meeting-house, or a court-house, or a jail, or a shop,
or a dwelling-house, and say what that thing really is before a true gaze, and
they would all go to pieces in your account of them. Men esteem truth remote,
in the outskirts of the system, behind the farthest star, before Adam and after
the last man. In eternity there is indeed something true and sublime. But all
these times and places and occasions are now and here. God himself culminates
in the present moment, and will never be more divine in the lapse of all the
ages. And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by
the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us. The
universe constantly and obediently answers to our conceptions; whether we
travel fast or slow, the track is laid for us. Let us spend our lives in
conceiving then. The poet or the artist never yet had so fair and noble a
design but some of his posterity at least could accomplish it.
</p>

<p>
Let us spend one day as deliberately as Nature, and not be thrown off the track
by every nutshell and mosquito&rsquo;s wing that falls on the rails. Let us
rise early and fast, or break fast, gently and without perturbation; let
company come and let company go, let the bells ring and the children
cry,&mdash;determined to make a day of it. Why should we knock under and go with
the stream? Let us not be upset and overwhelmed in that terrible rapid and
whirlpool called a dinner, situated in the meridian shallows. Weather this
danger and you are safe, for the rest of the way is down hill. With unrelaxed
nerves, with morning vigor, sail by it, looking another way, tied to the mast
like Ulysses. If the engine whistles, let it whistle till it is hoarse for its
pains. If the bell rings, why should we run? We will consider what kind of
music they are like. Let us settle ourselves, and work and wedge our feet
downward through the mud and slush of opinion, and prejudice, and tradition,
and delusion, and appearance, that alluvion which covers the globe, through
Paris and London, through New York and Boston and Concord, through church and
state, through poetry and philosophy and religion, till we come to a hard
bottom and rocks in place, which we can call <i>reality</i>, and say, This is,
and no mistake; and then begin, having a <i>point d&rsquo;appui</i>, below
freshet and frost and fire, a place where you might found a wall or a state, or
set a lamp-post safely, or perhaps a gauge, not a Nilometer, but a Realometer,
that future ages might know how deep a freshet of shams and appearances had
gathered from time to time. If you stand right fronting and face to face to a
fact, you will see the sun glimmer on both its surfaces, as if it were a
cimeter, and feel its sweet edge dividing you through the heart and marrow,
and so you will happily conclude your mortal career. Be it life or death, we
crave only reality. If we are really dying, let us hear the rattle in our
throats and feel cold in the extremities; if we are alive, let us go about our
business.
</p>

<p>
Time is but the stream I go a-fishing in. I drink at it; but while I drink I
see the sandy bottom and detect how shallow it is. Its thin current slides
away, but eternity remains. I would drink deeper; fish in the sky, whose bottom
is pebbly with stars. I cannot count one. I know not the first letter of the
alphabet. I have always been regretting that I was not as wise as the day I was
born. The intellect is a cleaver; it discerns and rifts its way into the secret
of things. I do not wish to be any more busy with my hands than is necessary.
My head is hands and feet. I feel all my best faculties concentrated in it. My
instinct tells me that my head is an organ for burrowing, as some creatures use
their snout and fore-paws, and with it I would mine and burrow my way through
these hills. I think that the richest vein is somewhere hereabouts; so by the
divining-rod and thin rising vapors I judge; and here I will begin to mine.

<p>
With a little more deliberation in the choice of their pursuits, all men would
perhaps become essentially students and observers, for certainly their nature
and destiny are interesting to all alike. In accumulating property for
ourselves or our posterity, in founding a family or a state, or acquiring fame
even, we are mortal; but in dealing with truth we are immortal, and need fear
no change nor accident. The oldest Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a
corner of the veil from the statue of the divinity; and still the trembling
robe remains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did, since it was I
in him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now reviews the vision.
No dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since that divinity was
revealed. That time which we really improve, or which is improvable, is neither
past, present, nor future.
</p>

<p>
My residence was more favorable, not only to thought, but to serious reading,
than a university; and though I was beyond the range of the ordinary
circulating library, I had more than ever come within the influence of those
books which circulate round the world, whose sentences were first written on
bark, and are now merely copied from time to time on to linen paper. Says the
poet M√Ær Camar Udd√Æn Mast, &ldquo;Being seated to run through the region of
the spiritual world; I have had this advantage in books. To be intoxicated by a
single glass of wine; I have experienced this pleasure when I have drunk the
liquor of the esoteric doctrines.&rdquo; I kept Homer&rsquo;s Iliad on my table
through the summer, though I looked at his page only now and then. Incessant
labor with my hands, at first, for I had my house to finish and my beans to hoe
at the same time, made more study impossible. Yet I sustained myself by the
prospect of such reading in future. I read one or two shallow books of travel
in the intervals of my work, till that employment made me ashamed of myself,
and I asked where it was then that <i>I</i> lived.
</p>

<p>
The student may read Homer or √Üschylus in the Greek without danger of
dissipation or luxuriousness, for it implies that he in some measure emulate
their heroes, and consecrate morning hours to their pages. The heroic books,
even if printed in the character of our mother tongue, will always be in a
language dead to degenerate times; and we must laboriously seek the meaning of
each word and line, conjecturing a larger sense than common use permits out of
what wisdom and valor and generosity we have. The modern cheap and fertile
press, with all its translations, has done little to bring us nearer to the
heroic writers of antiquity. They seem as solitary, and the letter in which
they are printed as rare and curious, as ever. It is worth the expense of
youthful days and costly hours, if you learn only some words of an ancient
language, which are raised out of the trivialness of the street, to be
perpetual suggestions and provocations. It is not in vain that the farmer
remembers and repeats the few Latin words which he has heard. Men sometimes
speak as if the study of the classics would at length make way for more modern
and practical studies; but the adventurous student will always study classics,
in whatever language they may be written and however ancient they may be. For
what are the classics but the noblest recorded thoughts of man? They are the
only oracles which are not decayed, and there are such answers to the most
modern inquiry in them as Delphi and Dodona never gave. We might as well omit
to study Nature because she is old. To read well, that is, to read true books
in a true spirit, is a noble exercise, and one that will task the reader more
than any exercise which the customs of the day esteem. It requires a training
such as the athletes underwent, the steady intention almost of the whole life
to this object. Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were
written. It is not enough even to be able to speak the language of that nation
by which they are written, for there is a memorable interval between the spoken
and the written language, the language heard and the language read. The one is
commonly transitory, a sound, a tongue, a dialect merely, almost brutish, and
we learn it unconsciously, like the brutes, of our mothers. The other is the
maturity and experience of that; if that is our mother tongue, this is our
father tongue, a reserved and select expression, too significant to be heard by
the ear, which we must be born again in order to speak. The crowds of men who
merely <i>spoke</i> the Greek and Latin tongues in the middle ages were not
entitled by the accident of birth to <i>read</i> the works of genius written in
those languages; for these were not written in that Greek or Latin which they
knew, but in the select language of literature. They had not learned the nobler
dialects of Greece and Rome, but the very materials on which they were written
were waste paper to them, and they prized instead a cheap contemporary
literature. But when the several nations of Europe had acquired distinct though
rude written languages of their own, sufficient for the purposes of their
rising literatures, then first learning revived, and scholars were enabled to
discern from that remoteness the treasures of antiquity. What the Roman and
Grecian multitude could not <i>hear</i>, after the lapse of ages a few scholars
<i>read</i>, and a few scholars only are still reading it.

However much we may admire the orator&rsquo;s occasional bursts of eloquence,
the noblest written words are commonly as far behind or above the fleeting
spoken language as the firmament with its stars is behind the clouds.
<i>There</i> are the stars, and they who can may read them. The astronomers
forever comment on and observe them. They are not exhalations like our daily
colloquies and vaporous breath. What is called eloquence in the forum is
commonly found to be rhetoric in the study. The orator yields to the
inspiration of a transient occasion, and speaks to the mob before him, to those
who can <i>hear</i> him; but the writer, whose more equable life is his
occasion, and who would be distracted by the event and the crowd which inspire
the orator, speaks to the intellect and health of mankind, to all in any age
who can <i>understand</i> him.

No wonder that Alexander carried the Iliad with him on his expeditions in a
precious casket. A written word is the choicest of relics. It is something at
once more intimate with us and more universal than any other work of art. It is
the work of art nearest to life itself. It may be translated into every
language, and not only be read but actually breathed from all human
lips;&mdash;not be represented on canvas or in marble only, but be carved out
of the breath of life itself. The symbol of an ancient man&rsquo;s thought
becomes a modern man&rsquo;s speech. Two thousand summers have imparted to the
monuments of Grecian literature, as to her marbles, only a maturer golden and
autumnal tint, for they have carried their own serene and celestial atmosphere
into all lands to protect them against the corrosion of time. Books are the
treasured wealth of the world and the fit inheritance of generations and
nations. Books, the oldest and the best, stand naturally and rightfully on the
shelves of every cottage. They have no cause of their own to plead, but while
they enlighten and sustain the reader his common sense will not refuse them.
Their authors are a natural and irresistible aristocracy in every society, and,
more than kings or emperors, exert an influence on mankind. When the illiterate
and perhaps scornful trader has earned by enterprise and industry his coveted
leisure and independence, and is admitted to the circles of wealth and fashion,
he turns inevitably at last to those still higher but yet inaccessible circles
of intellect and genius, and is sensible only of the imperfection of his
culture and the vanity and insufficiency of all his riches, and further proves
his good sense by the pains which he takes to secure for his children that
intellectual culture whose want he so keenly feels; and thus it is that he
becomes the founder of a family.

Those who have not learned to read the ancient classics in the language in
which they were written must have a very imperfect knowledge of the history of
the human race; for it is remarkable that no transcript of them has ever been
made into any modern tongue, unless our civilization itself may be regarded as
such a transcript. Homer has never yet been printed in English, nor
√Üschylus, nor Virgil even&mdash;works as refined, as solidly done, and as
beautiful almost as the morning itself; for later writers, say what we will of
their genius, have rarely, if ever, equalled the elaborate beauty and finish
and the lifelong and heroic literary labors of the ancients. They only talk of
forgetting them who never knew them. It will be soon enough to forget them when
we have the learning and the genius which will enable us to attend to and
appreciate them. That age will be rich indeed when those relics which we call
Classics, and the still older and more than classic but even less known
Scriptures of the nations, shall have still further accumulated, when the
Vaticans shall be filled with Vedas and Zendavestas and Bibles, with Homers and
Dantes and Shakespeares, and all the centuries to come shall have successively
deposited their trophies in the forum of the world. By such a pile we may hope
to scale heaven at last.

The works of the great poets have never yet been read by mankind, for only
great poets can read them. They have only been read as the multitude read the
stars, at most astrologically, not astronomically. Most men have learned to
read to serve a paltry convenience, as they have learned to cipher in order to
keep accounts and not be cheated in trade; but of reading as a noble
intellectual exercise they know little or nothing; yet this only is reading, in
a high sense, not that which lulls us as a luxury and suffers the nobler
faculties to sleep the while, but what we have to stand on tip-toe to read and
devote our most alert and wakeful hours to.
</p>

<p>
I think that having learned our letters we should read the best that is in
literature, and not be forever repeating our a b abs, and words of one
syllable, in the fourth or fifth classes, sitting on the lowest and foremost
form all our lives. Most men are satisfied if they read or hear read, and
perchance have been convicted by the wisdom of one good book, the Bible, and
for the rest of their lives vegetate and dissipate their faculties in what is
called easy reading. There is a work in several volumes in our Circulating
Library entitled Little Reading, which I thought referred to a town of that
name which I had not been to. There are those who, like cormorants and
ostriches, can digest all sorts of this, even after the fullest dinner of meats
and vegetables, for they suffer nothing to be wasted. If others are the
machines to provide this provender, they are the machines to read it. They read
the nine thousandth tale about Zebulon and Sephronia, and how they loved as
none had ever loved before, and neither did the course of their true love run
smooth,&mdash;at any rate, how it did run and stumble, and get up again and go
on! how some poor unfortunate got up on to a steeple, who had better never have
gone up as far as the belfry; and then, having needlessly got him up there, the
happy novelist rings the bell for all the world to come together and hear, O
dear! how he did get down again! For my part, I think that they had better
metamorphose all such aspiring heroes of universal noveldom into man
weathercocks, as they used to put heroes among the constellations, and let them
swing round there till they are rusty, and not come down at all to bother
honest men with their pranks. The next time the novelist rings the bell I will
not stir though the meeting-house burn down. &ldquo;The Skip of the
Tip-Toe-Hop, a Romance of the Middle Ages, by the celebrated author of
&lsquo;Tittle-Tol-Tan,&rsquo; to appear in monthly parts; a great rush;
don&rsquo;t all come together.&rdquo; All this they read with saucer eyes, and
erect and primitive curiosity, and with unwearied gizzard, whose corrugations
even yet need no sharpening, just as some little four-year-old bencher his
two-cent gilt-covered edition of Cinderella,&mdash;without any improvement,
that I can see, in the pronunciation, or accent, or emphasis, or any more skill
in extracting or inserting the moral. The result is dulness of sight, a
stagnation of the vital circulations, and a general deliquium and sloughing off
of all the intellectual faculties. This sort of gingerbread is baked daily and
more sedulously than pure wheat or rye-and-Indian in almost every oven, and
finds a surer market.
</p>

<p>
The best books are not read even by those who are called good readers. What
does our Concord culture amount to? There is in this town, with a very few
exceptions, no taste for the best or for very good books even in English
literature, whose words all can read and spell. Even the college-bred and so
called liberally educated men here and elsewhere have really little or no
acquaintance with the English classics; and as for the recorded wisdom of
mankind, the ancient classics and Bibles, which are accessible to all who will
know of them, there are the feeblest efforts any where made to become
acquainted with them. I know a woodchopper, of middle age, who takes a French
paper, not for news as he says, for he is above that, but to &ldquo;keep
himself in practice,&rdquo; he being a Canadian by birth; and when I ask him
what he considers the best thing he can do in this world, he says, beside this,
to keep up and add to his English. This is about as much as the college bred
generally do or aspire to do, and they take an English paper for the purpose.
One who has just come from reading perhaps one of the best English books will
find how many with whom he can converse about it? Or suppose he comes from
reading a Greek or Latin classic in the original, whose praises are familiar
even to the so called illiterate; he will find nobody at all to speak to, but
must keep silence about it. Indeed, there is hardly the professor in our
colleges, who, if he has mastered the difficulties of the language, has
proportionally mastered the difficulties of the wit and poetry of a Greek poet,
and has any sympathy to impart to the alert and heroic reader; and as for the
sacred Scriptures, or Bibles of mankind, who in this town can tell me even
their titles? Most men do not know that any nation but the Hebrews have had a
scripture. A man, any man, will go considerably out of his way to pick up a
silver dollar; but here are golden words, which the wisest men of antiquity
have uttered, and whose worth the wise of every succeeding age have assured us
of;&mdash;and yet we learn to read only as far as Easy Reading, the primers and
class-books, and when we leave school, the &ldquo;Little Reading,&rdquo; and
story books, which are for boys and beginners; and our reading, our
conversation and thinking, are all on a very low level, worthy only of pygmies
and manikins.
</p>

<p>
I aspire to be acquainted with wiser men than this our Concord soil has
produced, whose names are hardly known here. Or shall I hear the name of Plato
and never read his book? As if Plato were my townsman and I never saw
him,&mdash;my next neighbor and I never heard him speak or attended to the
wisdom of his words. But how actually is it? His Dialogues, which contain what
was immortal in him, lie on the next shelf, and yet I never read them. We are
underbred and low-lived and illiterate; and in this respect I confess I do not
make any very broad distinction between the illiterateness of my townsman who
cannot read at all, and the illiterateness of him who has learned to read only
what is for children and feeble intellects. We should be as good as the
worthies of antiquity, but partly by first knowing how good they were. We are a
race of tit-men, and soar but little higher in our intellectual flights than
the columns of the daily paper.
</p>

<p>
It is not all books that are as dull as their readers. There are probably words
addressed to our condition exactly, which, if we could really hear and
understand, would be more salutary than the morning or the spring to our lives,
and possibly put a new aspect on the face of things for us. How many a man has
dated a new era in his life from the reading of a book. The book exists for us
perchance which will explain our miracles and reveal new ones. The at present
unutterable things we may find somewhere uttered. These same questions that
disturb and puzzle and confound us have in their turn occurred to all the wise
men; not one has been omitted; and each has answered them, according to his
ability, by his words and his life. Moreover, with wisdom we shall learn
liberality. The solitary hired man on a farm in the outskirts of Concord, who
has had his second birth and peculiar religious experience, and is driven as he
believes into the silent gravity and exclusiveness by his faith, may think it
is not true; but Zoroaster, thousands of years ago, travelled the same road and
had the same experience; but he, being wise, knew it to be universal, and
treated his neighbors accordingly, and is even said to have invented and
established worship among men. Let him humbly commune with Zoroaster then, and
through the liberalizing influence of all the worthies, with Jesus Christ
himself, and let &ldquo;our church&rdquo; go by the board.
</p>

<p>
We boast that we belong to the nineteenth century and are making the most rapid
strides of any nation. But consider how little this village does for its own
culture. I do not wish to flatter my townsmen, nor to be flattered by them, for
that will not advance either of us. We need to be provoked,&mdash;goaded like
oxen, as we are, into a trot. We have a comparatively decent system of common
schools, schools for infants only; but excepting the half-starved Lyceum in the
winter, and latterly the puny beginning of a library suggested by the state, no
school for ourselves. We spend more on almost any article of bodily aliment or
ailment than on our mental aliment. It is time that we had uncommon schools,
that we did not leave off our education when we begin to be men and women. It
is time that villages were universities, and their elder inhabitants the
fellows of universities, with leisure&mdash;if they are indeed so well
off&mdash;to pursue liberal studies the rest of their lives. Shall the world be
confined to one Paris or one Oxford forever? Cannot students be boarded here
and get a liberal education under the skies of Concord? Can we not hire some
Abelard to lecture to us? Alas! what with foddering the cattle and tending the
store, we are kept from school too long, and our education is sadly neglected.
In this country, the village should in some respects take the place of the
nobleman of Europe. It should be the patron of the fine arts. It is rich
enough. It wants only the magnanimity and refinement. It can spend money enough
on such things as farmers and traders value, but it is thought Utopian to
propose spending money for things which more intelligent men know to be of far
more worth. This town has spent seventeen thousand dollars on a town-house,
thank fortune or politics, but probably it will not spend so much on living
wit, the true meat to put into that shell, in a hundred years. The one hundred
and twenty-five dollars annually subscribed for a Lyceum in the winter is
better spent than any other equal sum raised in the town. If we live in the
nineteenth century, why should we not enjoy the advantages which the nineteenth
century offers? Why should our life be in any respect provincial? If we will
read newspapers, why not skip the gossip of Boston and take the best newspaper
in the world at once?&mdash;not be sucking the pap of &ldquo;neutral
family&rdquo; papers, or browsing &ldquo;Olive-Branches&rdquo; here in New
England. Let the reports of all the learned societies come to us, and we will
see if they know any thing. Why should we leave it to Harper &amp; Brothers and
Redding &amp; Co. to select our reading? As the nobleman of cultivated taste
surrounds himself with whatever conduces to his
culture,&mdash;genius&mdash;learning&mdash;wit&mdash;books&mdash;paintings&mdash;statuary&mdash;music&mdash;philosophical
instruments, and the like; so let the village do,&mdash;not stop short at a
pedagogue, a parson, a sexton, a parish library, and three selectmen, because
our pilgrim forefathers got through a cold winter once on a bleak rock with
these. To act collectively is according to the spirit of our institutions; and
I am confident that, as our circumstances are more flourishing, our means are
greater than the nobleman&rsquo;s. New England can hire all the wise men in the
world to come and teach her, and board them round the while, and not be
provincial at all. That is the <i>uncommon</i> school we want. Instead of
noblemen, let us have noble villages of men. If it is necessary, omit one
bridge over the river, go round a little there, and throw one arch at least
over the darker gulf of ignorance which surrounds us.

But while we are confined to books, though the most select and classic, and
read only particular written languages, which are themselves but dialects and
provincial, we are in danger of forgetting the language which all things and
events speak without metaphor, which alone is copious and standard. Much is
published, but little printed. The rays which stream through the shutter will
be no longer remembered when the shutter is wholly removed. No method nor
discipline can supersede the necessity of being forever on the alert. What is a
course of history, or philosophy, or poetry, no matter how well selected, or the
best society, or the most admirable routine of life, compared with the
discipline of looking always at what is to be seen? Will you be a reader, a
student merely, or a seer? Read your fate, see what is before you, and walk on
into futurity.

I did not read books the first summer; I hoed beans. Nay, I often did better
than this. There were times when I could not afford to sacrifice the bloom of
the present moment to any work, whether of the head or hands. I love a broad
margin to my life. Sometimes, in a summer morning, having taken my accustomed
bath, I sat in my sunny doorway from sunrise till noon, rapt in a revery,
amidst the pines and hickories and sumachs, in undisturbed solitude and
stillness, while the birds sing around or flitted noiseless through the house,
until by the sun falling in at my west window, or the noise of some
traveller&rsquo;s wagon on the distant highway, I was reminded of the lapse of
time. I grew in those seasons like corn in the night, and they were far better
than any work of the hands would have been. They were not time subtracted from
my life, but so much over and above my usual allowance. I realized what the
Orientals mean by contemplation and the forsaking of works. For the most part,
I minded not how the hours went. The day advanced as if to light some work of
mine; it was morning, and lo, now it is evening, and nothing memorable is
accomplished. Instead of singing like the birds, I silently smiled at my
incessant good fortune. As the sparrow had its trill, sitting on the hickory
before my door, so had I my chuckle or suppressed warble which he might hear
out of my nest. My days were not days of the week, bearing the stamp of any
heathen deity, nor were they minced into hours and fretted by the ticking of a
clock; for I lived like the Puri Indians, of whom it is said that &ldquo;for
yesterday, to-day, and to-morrow they have only one word, and they express the
variety of meaning by pointing backward for yesterday, forward for to-morrow,
and overhead for the passing day.&rdquo; This was sheer idleness to my
fellow-townsmen, no doubt; but if the birds and flowers had tried me by their
standard, I should not have been found wanting. A man must find his occasions
in himself, it is true. The natural day is very calm, and will hardly reprove
his indolence.
</p>

<p>
I had this advantage, at least, in my mode of life, over those who were obliged
to look abroad for amusement, to society and the theatre, that my life itself
was become my amusement and never ceased to be novel. It was a drama of many
scenes and without an end. If we were always indeed getting our living, and
regulating our lives according to the last and best mode we had learned, we
should never be troubled with ennui. Follow your genius closely enough, and it
will not fail to show you a fresh prospect every hour. Housework was a pleasant
pastime. When my floor was dirty, I rose early, and, setting all my furniture
out of doors on the grass, bed and bedstead making but one budget, dashed water
on the floor, and sprinkled white sand from the pond on it, and then with a
broom scrubbed it clean and white; and by the time the villagers had broken
their fast the morning sun had dried my house sufficiently to allow me to move
in again, and my meditations were almost uninterupted. It was pleasant to see
my whole household effects out on the grass, making a little pile like a
gypsy&rsquo;s pack, and my three-legged table, from which I did not remove the
books and pen and ink, standing amid the pines and hickories. They seemed glad
to get out themselves, and as if unwilling to be brought in. I was sometimes
tempted to stretch an awning over them and take my seat there. It was worth the
while to see the sun shine on these things, and hear the free wind blow on
them; so much more interesting most familiar objects look out of doors than in
the house. A bird sits on the next bough, life-everlasting grows under the
table, and blackberry vines run round its legs; pine cones, chestnut burs, and
strawberry leaves are strewn about. It looked as if this was the way these
forms came to be transferred to our furniture, to tables, chairs, and
bedsteads,&mdash;because they once stood in their midst.
</p>

<p>
My house was on the side of a hill, immediately on the edge of the larger wood,
in the midst of a young forest of pitch pines and hickories, and half a dozen
rods from the pond, to which a narrow footpath led down the hill. In my front
yard grew the strawberry, blackberry, and life-everlasting, johnswort and
goldenrod, shrub-oaks and sand-cherry, blueberry and groundnut. Near the end of
May, the sand-cherry (<i>Cerasus pumila</i>,) adorned the sides of the path with
its delicate flowers arranged in umbels cylindrically about its short stems,
which last, in the fall, weighed down with good sized and handsome cherries,
fell over in wreaths like rays on every side. I tasted them out of compliment
to Nature, though they were scarcely palatable. The sumach (<i>Rhus glabra</i>,)
grew luxuriantly about the house, pushing up through the embankment which I had
made, and growing five or six feet the first season. Its broad pinnate tropical
leaf was pleasant though strange to look on. The large buds, suddenly pushing
out late in the spring from dry sticks which had seemed to be dead, developed
themselves as by magic into graceful green and tender boughs, an inch in
diameter; and sometimes, as I sat at my window, so heedlessly did they grow and
tax their weak joints, I heard a fresh and tender bough suddenly fall like a
fan to the ground, when there was not a breath of air stirring, broken off by
its own weight. In August, the large masses of berries, which, when in flower,
had attracted many wild bees, gradually assumed their bright velvety crimson
hue, and by their weight again bent down and broke the tender limbs.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
As I sit at my window this summer afternoon, hawks are circling about my
clearing; the tantivy of wild pigeons, flying by twos and threes athwart my
view, or perching restless on the white-pine boughs behind my house, gives a
voice to the air; a fishhawk dimples the glassy surface of the pond and brings
up a fish; a mink steals out of the marsh before my door and seizes a frog by
the shore; the sedge is bending under the weight of the reed-birds flitting
hither and thither; and for the last half hour I have heard the rattle of
railroad cars, now dying away and then reviving like the beat of a partridge,
conveying travellers from Boston to the country. For I did not live so out of
the world as that boy who, as I hear, was put out to a farmer in the east part
of the town, but ere long ran away and came home again, quite down at the heel
and homesick. He had never seen such a dull and out-of-the-way place; the folks
were all gone off; why, you couldn&rsquo;t even hear the whistle! I doubt if
there is such a place in Massachusetts now:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;In truth, our village has become a butt<br />
For one of those fleet railroad shafts, and o&rsquo;er<br />
Our peaceful plain its soothing sound is&mdash;Concord.&rdquo;

</p> <p>
The Fitchburg Railroad touches the pond about a hundred rods south of where I
dwell. I usually go to the village along its causeway, and am, as it were,
related to society by this link. The men on the freight trains, who go over the
whole length of the road, bow to me as to an old acquaintance, they pass me so
often, and apparently they take me for an employee; and so I am. I too would
fain be a track-repairer somewhere in the orbit of the earth.
</p>

<p>
The whistle of the locomotive penetrates my woods summer and winter, sounding
like the scream of a hawk sailing over some farmer&rsquo;s yard, informing me
that many restless city merchants are arriving within the circle of the town,
or adventurous country traders from the other side. As they come under one
horizon, they shout their warning to get off the track to the other, heard
sometimes through the circles of two towns. Here come your groceries, country;
your rations, countrymen! Nor is there any man so independent on his farm that
he can say them nay. And here&rsquo;s your pay for them! screams the
countryman&rsquo;s whistle; timber like long battering rams going twenty miles
an hour against the city&rsquo;s walls, and chairs enough to seat all the weary
and heavy laden that dwell within them. With such huge and lumbering civility
the country hands a chair to the city. All the Indian huckleberry hills are
stripped, all the cranberry meadows are raked into the city. Up comes the
cotton, down goes the woven cloth; up comes the silk, down goes the woollen; up
come the books, but down goes the wit that writes them.
</p>

<p>
When I meet the engine with its train of cars moving off with planetary
motion,&mdash;or, rather, like a comet, for the beholder knows not if with that
velocity and with that direction it will ever revisit this system, since its
orbit does not look like a returning curve,&mdash;with its steam cloud like a
banner streaming behind in golden and silver wreaths, like many a downy cloud
which I have seen, high in the heavens, unfolding its masses to the
light,&mdash;as if this travelling demigod, this cloud-compeller, would ere long
take the sunset sky for the livery of his train; when I hear the iron horse
make the hills echo with his snort like thunder, shaking the earth with his
feet, and breathing fire and smoke from his nostrils, (what kind of winged horse
or fiery dragon they will put into the new Mythology I don&rsquo;t know), it
seems as if the earth had got a race now worthy to inhabit it. If all were as
it seems, and men made the elements their servants for noble ends! If the cloud
that hangs over the engine were the perspiration of heroic deeds, or as
beneficent as that which floats over the farmer&rsquo;s fields, then the
elements and Nature herself would cheerfully accompany men on their errands and
be their escort.
</p>

<p>
I watch the passage of the morning cars with the same feeling that I do the
rising of the sun, which is hardly more regular. Their train of clouds
stretching far behind and rising higher and higher, going to heaven while the
cars are going to Boston, conceals the sun for a minute and casts my distant
field into the shade, a celestial train beside which the petty train of cars
which hugs the earth is but the barb of the spear. The stabler of the iron
horse was up early this winter morning by the light of the stars amid the
mountains, to fodder and harness his steed. Fire, too, was awakened thus early
to put the vital heat in him and get him off. If the enterprise were as
innocent as it is early! If the snow lies deep, they strap on his snow-shoes,
and with the giant plow, plow a furrow from the mountains to the seaboard, in
which the cars, like a following drill-barrow, sprinkle all the restless men
and floating merchandise in the country for seed. All day the fire-steed flies
over the country, stopping only that his master may rest, and I am awakened by
his tramp and defiant snort at midnight, when in some remote glen in the woods
he fronts the elements incased in ice and snow; and he will reach his stall
only with the morning star, to start once more on his travels without rest or
slumber. Or perchance, at evening, I hear him in his stable blowing off the
superfluous energy of the day, that he may calm his nerves and cool his liver
and brain for a few hours of iron slumber. If the enterprise were as heroic and
commanding as it is protracted and unwearied!
</p>

<p>
Far through unfrequented woods on the confines of towns, where once only the
hunter penetrated by day, in the darkest night dart these bright saloons
without the knowledge of their inhabitants; this moment stopping at some
brilliant station-house in town or city, where a social crowd is gathered, the
next in the Dismal Swamp, scaring the owl and fox. The startings and arrivals
of the cars are now the epochs in the village day. They go and come with such
regularity and precision, and their whistle can be heard so far, that the
farmers set their clocks by them, and thus one well conducted institution
regulates a whole country. Have not men improved somewhat in punctuality since
the railroad was invented? Do they not talk and think faster in the depot than
they did in the stage-office? There is something electrifying in the atmosphere
of the former place. I have been astonished at the miracles it has wrought;
that some of my neighbors, who, I should have prophesied, once for all, would
never get to Boston by so prompt a conveyance, are on hand when the bell rings.
To do things &ldquo;railroad fashion&rdquo; is now the by-word; and it is worth
the while to be warned so often and so sincerely by any power to get off its
track. There is no stopping to read the riot act, no firing over the heads of
the mob, in this case. We have constructed a fate, an <i>Atropos</i>, that
never turns aside. (Let that be the name of your engine.) Men are advertised
that at a certain hour and minute these bolts will be shot toward particular
points of the compass; yet it interferes with no man&rsquo;s business, and the
children go to school on the other track. We live the steadier for it. We are
all educated thus to be sons of Tell. The air is full of invisible bolts. Every
path but your own is the path of fate. Keep on your own track, then.
</p>

<p>
What recommends commerce to me is its enterprise and bravery. It does not clasp
its hands and pray to Jupiter. I see these men every day go about their
business with more or less courage and content, doing more even than they
suspect, and perchance better employed than they could have consciously
devised. I am less affected by their heroism who stood up for half an hour in
the front line at Buena Vista, than by the steady and cheerful valor of the men
who inhabit the snow-plough for their winter quarters; who have not merely the
three-o&rsquo;-clock in the morning courage, which Bonaparte thought was the
rarest, but whose courage does not go to rest so early, who go to sleep only
when the storm sleeps or the sinews of their iron steed are frozen. On this
morning of the Great Snow, perchance, which is still raging and chilling
men&rsquo;s blood, I hear the muffled tone of their engine bell from out the
fog bank of their chilled breath, which announces that the cars <i>are
coming</i>, without long delay, notwithstanding the veto of a New England
north-east snow storm, and I behold the ploughmen covered with snow and rime,
their heads peering, above the mould-board which is turning down other than
daisies and the nests of field-mice, like bowlders of the Sierra Nevada, that
occupy an outside place in the universe.
</p>

<p>
Commerce is unexpectedly confident and serene, alert, adventurous, and
unwearied. It is very natural in its methods withal, far more so than many
fantastic enterprises and sentimental experiments, and hence its singular
success. I am refreshed and expanded when the freight train rattles past me,
and I smell the stores which go dispensing their odors all the way from Long
Wharf to Lake Champlain, reminding me of foreign parts, of coral reefs, and
Indian oceans, and tropical climes, and the extent of the globe. I feel more
like a citizen of the world at the sight of the palm-leaf which will cover so
many flaxen New England heads the next summer, the Manilla hemp and cocoa-nut
husks, the old junk, gunny bags, scrap iron, and rusty nails. This car-load of
torn sails is more legible and interesting now than if they should be wrought
into paper and printed books. Who can write so graphically the history of the
storms they have weathered as these rents have done? They are proof-sheets
which need no correction. Here goes lumber from the Maine woods, which did not
go out to sea in the last freshet, risen four dollars on the thousand because
of what did go out or was split up; pine, spruce, cedar,&mdash;first, second,
third, and fourth qualities, so lately all of one quality, to wave over the
bear, and moose, and caribou. Next rolls Thomaston lime, a prime lot, which
will get far among the hills before it gets slacked. These rags in bales, of
all hues and qualities, the lowest condition to which cotton and linen descend,
the final result of dress,&mdash;of patterns which are now no longer cried up,
unless it be in Milwaukie, as those splendid articles, English, French, or
American prints, ginghams, muslins, &amp;c., gathered from all quarters both of
fashion and poverty, going to become paper of one color or a few shades only,
on which forsooth will be written tales of real life, high and low, and
founded on fact! This closed car smells of salt fish, the strong New England
and commercial scent, reminding me of the Grand Banks and the fisheries. Who
has not seen a salt fish, thoroughly cured for this world, so that nothing can
spoil it, and putting the perseverance of the saints to the blush? with which
you may sweep or pave the streets, and split your kindlings, and the teamster
shelter himself and his lading against sun wind and rain behind it,&mdash;and
the trader, as a Concord trader once did, hang it up by his door for a sign
when he commences business, until at last his oldest customer cannot tell
surely whether it be animal, vegetable, or mineral, and yet it shall be as pure
as a snowflake, and if it be put into a pot and boiled, will come out an
excellent dun fish for a Saturday&rsquo;s dinner. Next Spanish hides, with the
tails still preserving their twist and the angle of elevation they had when the
oxen that wore them were careering over the pampas of the Spanish main,&mdash;a
type of all obstinacy, and evincing how almost hopeless and incurable are all
constitutional vices. I confess, that practically speaking, when I have learned
a man&rsquo;s real disposition, I have no hopes of changing it for the better
or worse in this state of existence. As the Orientals say, &ldquo;A cur&rsquo;s
tail may be warmed, and pressed, and bound round with ligatures, and after a
twelve years&rsquo; labor bestowed upon it, still it will retain its natural
form.&rdquo; The only effectual cure for such inveteracies as these tails
exhibit is to make glue of them, which I believe is what is usually done with
them, and then they will stay put and stick. Here is a hogshead of molasses or
of brandy directed to John Smith, Cuttingsville, Vermont, some trader among the
Green Mountains, who imports for the farmers near his clearing, and now
perchance stands over his bulk-head and thinks of the last arrivals on the
coast, how they may affect the price for him, telling his customers this
moment, as he has told them twenty times before this morning, that he expects
some by the next train of prime quality. It is advertised in the Cuttingsville
Times.
</p>

<p>
While these things go up other things come down. Warned by the whizzing sound,
I look up from my book and see some tall pine, hewn on far northern hills,
which has winged its way over the Green Mountains and the Connecticut, shot
like an arrow through the township within ten minutes, and scarce another eye
beholds it; going
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;to be the mast<br />
Of some great ammiral.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
And hark! here comes the cattle-train bearing the cattle of a thousand hills,
sheepcots, stables, and cow-yards in the air, drovers with their sticks, and
shepherd boys in the midst of their flocks, all but the mountain pastures,
whirled along like leaves blown from the mountains by the September gales. The
air is filled with the bleating of calves and sheep, and the hustling of oxen,
as if a pastoral valley were going by. When the old bell-wether at the head
rattles his bell, the mountains do indeed skip like rams and the little hills
like lambs. A car-load of drovers, too, in the midst, on a level with their
droves now, their vocation gone, but still clinging to their useless sticks as
their badge of office. But their dogs, where are they? It is a stampede to
them; they are quite thrown out; they have lost the scent. Methinks I hear them
barking behind the Peterboro&rsquo; Hills, or panting up the western slope of
the Green Mountains. They will not be in at the death. Their vocation, too, is
gone. Their fidelity and sagacity are below par now. They will slink back to
their kennels in disgrace, or perchance run wild and strike a league with the
wolf and the fox. So is your pastoral life whirled past and away. But the bell
rings, and I must get off the track and let the cars go by;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
What&rsquo;s the railroad to me?<br />
I never go to see<br />
Where it ends.<br />
It fills a few hollows,<br />
And makes banks for the swallows,<br />
It sets the sand a-blowing,<br />
And the blackberries a-growing,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
but I cross it like a cart-path in the woods. I will not have my eyes put out
and my ears spoiled by its smoke and steam and hissing.<br /><br />
</p>

<p>
Now that the cars are gone by and all the restless world with them, and the
fishes in the pond no longer feel their rumbling, I am more alone than ever.
For the rest of the long afternoon, perhaps, my meditations are interrupted
only by the faint rattle of a carriage or team along the distant highway.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes, on Sundays, I heard the bells, the Lincoln, Acton, Bedford, or
Concord bell, when the wind was favorable, a faint, sweet, and, as it were,
natural melody, worth importing into the wilderness. At a sufficient distance
over the woods this sound acquires a certain vibratory hum, as if the pine
needles in the horizon were the strings of a harp which it swept. All sound
heard at the greatest possible distance produces one and the same effect, a
vibration of the universal lyre, just as the intervening atmosphere makes a
distant ridge of earth interesting to our eyes by the azure tint it imparts to
it. There came to me in this case a melody which the air had strained, and
which had conversed with every leaf and needle of the wood, that portion of the
sound which the elements had taken up and modulated and echoed from vale to
vale. The echo is, to some extent, an original sound, and therein is the magic
and charm of it. It is not merely a repetition of what was worth repeating in
the bell, but partly the voice of the wood; the same trivial words and notes
sung by a wood-nymph.
</p>

<p>
At evening, the distant lowing of some cow in the horizon beyond the woods
sounded sweet and melodious, and at first I would mistake it for the voices of
certain minstrels by whom I was sometimes serenaded, who might be straying over
hill and dale; but soon I was not unpleasantly disappointed when it was
prolonged into the cheap and natural music of the cow. I do not mean to be
satirical, but to express my appreciation of those youths&rsquo; singing, when
I state that I perceived clearly that it was akin to the music of the cow, and
they were at length one articulation of Nature.
</p>

<p>
Regularly at half past seven, in one part of the summer, after the evening
train had gone by, the whippoorwills chanted their vespers for half an hour,
sitting on a stump by my door, or upon the ridge pole of the house. They would
begin to sing almost with as much precision as a clock, within five minutes of
a particular time, referred to the setting of the sun, every evening. I had a
rare opportunity to become acquainted with their habits. Sometimes I heard four
or five at once in different parts of the wood, by accident one a bar behind
another, and so near me that I distinguished not only the cluck after each
note, but often that singular buzzing sound like a fly in a spider&rsquo;s web,
only proportionally louder. Sometimes one would circle round and round me in
the woods a few feet distant as if tethered by a string, when probably I was
near its eggs. They sang at intervals throughout the night, and were again as
musical as ever just before and about dawn.
</p>

<p>
When other birds are still the screech owls take up the strain, like mourning
women their ancient u-lu-lu. Their dismal scream is truly Ben Jonsonian. Wise
midnight hags! It is no honest and blunt tu-whit tu-who of the poets, but,
without jesting, a most solemn graveyard ditty, the mutual consolations of
suicide lovers remembering the pangs and the delights of supernal love in the
infernal groves. Yet I love to hear their wailing, their doleful responses,
trilled along the wood-side; reminding me sometimes of music and singing birds;
as if it were the dark and tearful side of music, the regrets and sighs that
would fain be sung. They are the spirits, the low spirits and melancholy
forebodings, of fallen souls that once in human shape night-walked the earth
and did the deeds of darkness, now expiating their sins with their wailing
hymns or threnodies in the scenery of their transgressions. They give me a new
sense of the variety and capacity of that nature which is our common dwelling.
<i>Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!</i> sighs one on this side of
the pond, and circles with the restlessness of despair to some new perch on the
gray oaks. Then&mdash;<i>that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!</i> echoes another
on the farther side with tremulous sincerity, and&mdash;<i>bor-r-r-r-n!</i>
comes faintly from far in the Lincoln woods.
</p>

<p>
I was also serenaded by a hooting owl. Near at hand you could fancy it the most
melancholy sound in Nature, as if she meant by this to stereotype and make
permanent in her choir the dying moans of a human being,&mdash;some poor weak
relic of mortality who has left hope behind, and howls like an animal, yet with
human sobs, on entering the dark valley, made more awful by a certain gurgling
melodiousness,&mdash;I find myself beginning with the letters gl when I try to
imitate it,&mdash;expressive of a mind which has reached the gelatinous mildewy
stage in the mortification of all healthy and courageous thought. It reminded
me of ghouls and idiots and insane howlings. But now one answers from far woods
in a strain made really melodious by distance,&mdash;<i>Hoo hoo hoo, hoorer
hoo</i>; and indeed for the most part it suggested only pleasing associations,
whether heard by day or night, summer or winter.
</p>

<p>
I rejoice that there are owls. Let them do the idiotic and maniacal hooting for
men. It is a sound admirably suited to swamps and twilight woods which no day
illustrates, suggesting a vast and undeveloped nature which men have not
recognized. They represent the stark twilight and unsatisfied thoughts which
all have. All day the sun has shone on the surface of some savage swamp, where
the single spruce stands hung with usnea lichens, and small hawks circulate
above, and the chickadee lisps amid the evergreens, and the partridge and
rabbit skulk beneath; but now a more dismal and fitting day dawns, and a
different race of creatures awakes to express the meaning of Nature there.
</p>

<p>
Late in the evening I heard the distant rumbling of wagons over
bridges,&mdash;a sound heard farther than almost any other at night,&mdash;the
baying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a
distant barn-yard. In the mean while all the shore rang with the trump of
bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers, still
unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake,&mdash;if the Walden
nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there are almost no weeds, there
are frogs there,&mdash;who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old
festal tables, though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave,
mocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become only liquor to
distend their paunches, and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory
of the past, but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most
aldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin to his
drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once
scorned water, and passes round the cup with the ejaculation <i>tr-r-r-oonk,
tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r-oonk!</i> and straightway comes over the water from some
distant cove the same password repeated, where the next in seniority and girth
has gulped down to his mark; and when this observance has made the circuit of
the shores, then ejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction,
<i>tr-r-r-oonk!</i> and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least
distended, leakiest, and flabbiest paunched, that there be no mistake; and then
the bowl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the morning mist,
and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly bellowing
<i>troonk</i> from time to time, and pausing for a reply.
</p>

<p>
I am not sure that I ever heard the sound of cock-crowing from my clearing, and
I thought that it might be worth the while to keep a cockerel for his music
merely, as a singing bird. The note of this once wild Indian pheasant is
certainly the most remarkable of any bird&rsquo;s, and if they could be
naturalized without being domesticated, it would soon become the most famous
sound in our woods, surpassing the clangor of the goose and the hooting of the
owl; and then imagine the cackling of the hens to fill the pauses when their
lords&rsquo; clarions rested! No wonder that man added this bird to his tame
stock,&mdash;to say nothing of the eggs and drumsticks. To walk in a winter
morning in a wood where these birds abounded, their native woods, and hear the
wild cockerels crow on the trees, clear and shrill for miles over the
resounding earth, drowning the feebler notes of other birds,&mdash;think of it!
It would put nations on the alert. Who would not be early to rise, and rise
earlier and earlier every successive day of his life, till he became
unspeakably healthy, wealthy, and wise? This foreign bird&rsquo;s note is
celebrated by the poets of all countries along with the notes of their native
songsters. All climates agree with brave Chanticleer. He is more indigenous
even than the natives. His health is ever good, his lungs are sound, his
spirits never flag. Even the sailor on the Atlantic and Pacific is awakened by
his voice; but its shrill sound never roused me from my slumbers. I kept
neither dog, cat, cow, pig, nor hens, so that you would have said there was a
deficiency of domestic sounds; neither the churn, nor the spinning wheel, nor
even the singing of the kettle, nor the hissing of the urn, nor children
crying, to comfort one. An old-fashioned man would have lost his senses or died
of ennui before this. Not even rats in the wall, for they were starved out, or
rather were never baited in,&mdash;only squirrels on the roof and under the
floor, a whippoorwill on the ridge pole, a blue-jay screaming beneath the
window, a hare or woodchuck under the house, a screech-owl or a cat-owl behind
it, a flock of wild geese or a laughing loon on the pond, and a fox to bark in
the night. Not even a lark or an oriole, those mild plantation birds, ever
visited my clearing. No cockerels to crow nor hens to cackle in the yard. No
yard! but unfenced Nature reaching up to your very sills. A young forest
growing up under your meadows, and wild sumachs and blackberry vines breaking
through into your cellar; sturdy pitch pines rubbing and creaking against the
shingles for want of room, their roots reaching quite under the house. Instead
of a scuttle or a blind blown off in the gale,&mdash;a pine tree snapped off or
torn up by the roots behind your house for fuel. Instead of no path to the
front-yard gate in the Great Snow,&mdash;no gate,&mdash;no
front-yard,&mdash;and no path to the civilized world!
</p>

<p><a name="chap06"></a></p> <h2>Solitude</h2>

<p>
This is a delicious evening, when the whole body is one sense, and imbibes
delight through every pore. I go and come with a strange liberty in Nature, a
part of herself. As I walk along the stony shore of the pond in my
shirt sleeves, though it is cool as well as cloudy and windy, and I see nothing
special to attract me, all the elements are unusually congenial to me. The
bullfrogs trump to usher in the night, and the note of the whippoorwill is
borne on the rippling wind from over the water. Sympathy with the fluttering
alder and poplar leaves almost takes away my breath; yet, like the lake, my
serenity is rippled but not ruffled. These small waves raised by the evening
wind are as remote from storm as the smooth reflecting surface. Though it is
now dark, the wind still blows and roars in the wood, the waves still dash, and
some creatures lull the rest with their notes. The repose is never complete.
The wildest animals do not repose, but seek their prey now; the fox, and skunk,
and rabbit, now roam the fields and woods without fear. They are Nature&rsquo;s
watchmen,&mdash;links which connect the days of animated life.
</p>

<p>
When I return to my house I find that visitors have been there and left their
cards, either a bunch of flowers, or a wreath of evergreen, or a name in pencil
on a yellow walnut leaf or a chip. They who come rarely to the woods take some
little piece of the forest into their hands to play with by the way, which they
leave, either intentionally or accidentally. One has peeled a willow wand,
woven it into a ring, and dropped it on my table. I could always tell if
visitors had called in my absence, either by the bended twigs or grass, or the
print of their shoes, and generally of what sex or age or quality they were by
some slight trace left, as a flower dropped, or a bunch of grass plucked and
thrown away, even as far off as the railroad, half a mile distant, or by the
lingering odor of a cigar or pipe. Nay, I was frequently notified of the
passage of a traveller along the highway sixty rods off by the scent of his
pipe.
</p>

<p>
There is commonly sufficient space about us. Our horizon is never quite at our
elbows. The thick wood is not just at our door, nor the pond, but somewhat is
always clearing, familiar and worn by us, appropriated and fenced in some way,
and reclaimed from Nature. For what reason have I this vast range and circuit,
some square miles of unfrequented forest, for my privacy, abandoned to me by
men? My nearest neighbor is a mile distant, and no house is visible from any
place but the hill-tops within half a mile of my own. I have my horizon bounded
by woods all to myself; a distant view of the railroad where it touches the
pond on the one hand, and of the fence which skirts the woodland road on the
other. But for the most part it is as solitary where I live as on the prairies.
It is as much Asia or Africa as New England. I have, as it were, my own sun and
moon and stars, and a little world all to myself. At night there was never a
traveller passed my house, or knocked at my door, more than if I were the first
or last man; unless it were in the spring, when at long intervals some came
from the village to fish for pouts,&mdash;they plainly fished much more in the
Walden Pond of their own natures, and baited their hooks with
darkness,&mdash;but they soon retreated, usually with light baskets, and left
&ldquo;the world to darkness and to me,&rdquo; and the black kernel of the
night was never profaned by any human neighborhood. I believe that men are
generally still a little afraid of the dark, though the witches are all hung,
and Christianity and candles have been introduced.
</p>

<p>
Yet I experienced sometimes that the most sweet and tender, the most innocent
and encouraging society may be found in any natural object, even for the poor
misanthrope and most melancholy man. There can be no very black melancholy to
him who lives in the midst of Nature and has his senses still. There was never
yet such a storm but it was √Üolian music to a healthy and innocent ear. Nothing
can rightly compel a simple and brave man to a vulgar sadness. While I enjoy
the friendship of the seasons I trust that nothing can make life a burden to
me. The gentle rain which waters my beans and keeps me in the house to-day is
not drear and melancholy, but good for me too. Though it prevents my hoeing
them, it is of far more worth than my hoeing. If it should continue so long as
to cause the seeds to rot in the ground and destroy the potatoes in the low
lands, it would still be good for the grass on the uplands, and, being good for
the grass, it would be good for me. Sometimes, when I compare myself with other
men, it seems as if I were more favored by the gods than they, beyond any
deserts that I am conscious of; as if I had a warrant and surety at their hands
which my fellows have not, and were especially guided and guarded. I do not
flatter myself, but if it be possible they flatter me. I have never felt
lonesome, or in the least oppressed by a sense of solitude, but once, and that
was a few weeks after I came to the woods, when, for an hour, I doubted if the
near neighborhood of man was not essential to a serene and healthy life. To be
alone was something unpleasant. But I was at the same time conscious of a
slight insanity in my mood, and seemed to foresee my recovery. In the midst of
a gentle rain while these thoughts prevailed, I was suddenly sensible of such
sweet and beneficent society in Nature, in the very pattering of the drops, and
in every sound and sight around my house, an infinite and unaccountable
friendliness all at once like an atmosphere sustaining me, as made the fancied
advantages of human neighborhood insignificant, and I have never thought of
them since. Every little pine needle expanded and swelled with sympathy and
befriended me. I was so distinctly made aware of the presence of something
kindred to me, even in scenes which we are accustomed to call wild and dreary,
and also that the nearest of blood to me and humanest was not a person nor a
villager, that I thought no place could ever be strange to me again.&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Mourning untimely consumes the sad;<br />
Few are their days in the land of the living,<br />
Beautiful daughter of Toscar.&rdquo;<br />
</p>

<p>
Some of my pleasantest hours were during the long rain storms in the spring or
fall, which confined me to the house for the afternoon as well as the forenoon,
soothed by their ceaseless roar and pelting; when an early twilight ushered in
a long evening in which many thoughts had time to take root and unfold
themselves. In those driving north-east rains which tried the village houses so,
when the maids stood ready with mop and pail in front entries to keep the
deluge out, I sat behind my door in my little house, which was all entry, and
thoroughly enjoyed its protection. In one heavy thunder shower the lightning
struck a large pitch-pine across the pond, making a very conspicuous and
perfectly regular spiral groove from top to bottom, an inch or more deep, and
four or five inches wide, as you would groove a walking-stick. I passed it
again the other day, and was struck with awe on looking up and beholding that
mark, now more distinct than ever, where a terrific and resistless bolt came
down out of the harmless sky eight years ago. Men frequently say to me,
&ldquo;I should think you would feel lonesome down there, and want to be nearer
to folks, rainy and snowy days and nights especially.&rdquo; I am tempted to
reply to such,&mdash;This whole earth which we inhabit is but a point in space.
How far apart, think you, dwell the two most distant inhabitants of yonder
star, the breadth of whose disk cannot be appreciated by our instruments? Why
should I feel lonely? is not our planet in the Milky Way? This which you put
seems to me not to be the most important question. What sort of space is that
which separates a man from his fellows and makes him solitary? I have found
that no exertion of the legs can bring two minds much nearer to one another.
What do we want most to dwell near to? Not to many men surely, the depot, the
post-office, the bar-room, the meeting-house, the school-house, the grocery,
Beacon Hill, or the Five Points, where men most congregate, but to the
perennial source of our life, whence in all our experience we have found that
to issue, as the willow stands near the water and sends out its roots in that
direction. This will vary with different natures, but this is the place where a
wise man will dig his cellar.... I one evening overtook one of my townsmen, who
has accumulated what is called &ldquo;a handsome property,&rdquo;&mdash;though I
never got a <i>fair</i> view of it,&mdash;on the Walden road, driving a pair of
cattle to market, who inquired of me how I could bring my mind to give up so
many of the comforts of life. I answered that I was very sure I liked it
passably well; I was not joking. And so I went home to my bed, and left him to
pick his way through the darkness and the mud to Brighton,&mdash;or
Bright-town,&mdash;which place he would reach some time in the morning.
</p>

<p>
Any prospect of awakening or coming to life to a dead man makes indifferent all
times and places. The place where that may occur is always the same, and
indescribably pleasant to all our senses. For the most part we allow only
outlying and transient circumstances to make our occasions. They are, in fact,
the cause of our distraction. Nearest to all things is that power which
fashions their being. <i>Next</i> to us the grandest laws are continually being
executed. <i>Next</i> to us is not the workman whom we have hired, with whom we
love so well to talk, but the workman whose work we are.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How vast and profound is the influence of the subtile powers of Heaven
and of Earth!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We seek to perceive them, and we do not see them; we seek to hear them,
and we do not hear them; identified with the substance of things, they cannot
be separated from them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They cause that in all the universe men purify and sanctify their
hearts, and clothe themselves in their holiday garments to offer sacrifices and
oblations to their ancestors. It is an ocean of subtile intelligences. They are
every where, above us, on our left, on our right; they environ us on all
sides.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
We are the subjects of an experiment which is not a little interesting to me.
Can we not do without the society of our gossips a little while under these
circumstances,&mdash;have our own thoughts to cheer us? Confucius says truly,
&ldquo;Virtue does not remain as an abandoned orphan; it must of necessity have
neighbors.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With thinking we may be beside ourselves in a sane sense. By a conscious effort
of the mind we can stand aloof from actions and their consequences; and all
things, good and bad, go by us like a torrent. We are not wholly involved in
Nature. I may be either the drift-wood in the stream, or Indra in the sky
looking down on it. I <i>may</i> be affected by a theatrical exhibition; on the
other hand, I <i>may not</i> be affected by an actual event which appears to
concern me much more. I only know myself as a human entity; the scene, so to
speak, of thoughts and affections; and am sensible of a certain doubleness by
which I can stand as remote from myself as from another. However intense my
experience, I am conscious of the presence and criticism of a part of me,
which, as it were, is not a part of me, but spectator, sharing no experience,
but taking note of it; and that is no more I than it is you. When the play, it
may be the tragedy, of life is over, the spectator goes his way. It was a kind
of fiction, a work of the imagination only, so far as he was concerned. This
doubleness may easily make us poor neighbors and friends sometimes.
</p>

<p>
I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company,
even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I
never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude. We are for the
most part more lonely when we go abroad among men than when we stay in our
chambers. A man thinking or working is always alone, let him be where he will.
Solitude is not measured by the miles of space that intervene between a man and
his fellows. The really diligent student in one of the crowded hives of
Cambridge College is as solitary as a dervish in the desert. The farmer can
work alone in the field or the woods all day, hoeing or chopping, and not feel
lonesome, because he is employed; but when he comes home at night he cannot sit
down in a room alone, at the mercy of his thoughts, but must be where he can
&ldquo;see the folks,&rdquo; and recreate, and as he thinks remunerate
himself for his day&rsquo;s solitude; and hence he wonders how the student can
sit alone in the house all night and most of the day without ennui and
&ldquo;the blues;&rdquo; but he does not realize that the student, though in
the house, is still at work in <i>his</i> field, and chopping in <i>his</i>
woods, as the farmer in his, and in turn seeks the same recreation and society
that the latter does, though it may be a more condensed form of it.
</p>

<p>
Society is commonly too cheap. We meet at very short intervals, not having had
time to acquire any new value for each other. We meet at meals three times a
day, and give each other a new taste of that old musty cheese that we are. We
have had to agree on a certain set of rules, called etiquette and politeness,
to make this frequent meeting tolerable and that we need not come to open war.
We meet at the post-office, and at the sociable, and about the fireside every
night; we live thick and are in each other&rsquo;s way, and stumble over one
another, and I think that we thus lose some respect for one another. Certainly
less frequency would suffice for all important and hearty communications.
Consider the girls in a factory,&mdash;never alone, hardly in their dreams. It
would be better if there were but one inhabitant to a square mile, as where I
live. The value of a man is not in his skin, that we should touch him.
</p>

<p>
I have heard of a man lost in the woods and dying of famine and exhaustion at
the foot of a tree, whose loneliness was relieved by the grotesque visions with
which, owing to bodily weakness, his diseased imagination surrounded him, and
which he believed to be real. So also, owing to bodily and mental health and
strength, we may be continually cheered by a like but more normal and natural
society, and come to know that we are never alone.
</p>

<p>
I have a great deal of company in my house; especially in the morning, when
nobody calls. Let me suggest a few comparisons, that some one may convey an
idea of my situation. I am no more lonely than the loon in the pond that laughs
so loud, or than Walden Pond itself. What company has that lonely lake, I pray?
And yet it has not the blue devils, but the blue angels in it, in the azure
tint of its waters. The sun is alone, except in thick weather, when there
sometimes appear to be two, but one is a mock sun. God is alone,&mdash;but the
devil, he is far from being alone; he sees a great deal of company; he is
legion. I am no more lonely than a single mullein or dandelion in a pasture, or
a bean leaf, or sorrel, or a horse-fly, or a bumble-bee. I am no more lonely
than the Mill Brook, or a weathercock, or the north star, or the south wind, or
an April shower, or a January thaw, or the first spider in a new house.
</p>

<p>
I have occasional visits in the long winter evenings, when the snow falls fast
and the wind howls in the wood, from an old settler and original proprietor,
who is reported to have dug Walden Pond, and stoned it, and fringed it with
pine woods; who tells me stories of old time and of new eternity; and between
us we manage to pass a cheerful evening with social mirth and pleasant views of
things, even without apples or cider,&mdash;a most wise and humorous friend,
whom I love much, who keeps himself more secret than ever did Goffe or Whalley;
and though he is thought to be dead, none can show where he is buried. An
elderly dame, too, dwells in my neighborhood, invisible to most persons, in
whose odorous herb garden I love to stroll sometimes, gathering simples and
listening to her fables; for she has a genius of unequalled fertility, and her
memory runs back farther than mythology, and she can tell me the original of
every fable, and on what fact every one is founded, for the incidents occurred
when she was young. A ruddy and lusty old dame, who delights in all weathers
and seasons, and is likely to outlive all her children yet.

<p>
The indescribable innocence and beneficence of Nature,&mdash;of sun and wind and
rain, of summer and winter,&mdash;such health, such cheer, they afford forever!
and such sympathy have they ever with our race, that all Nature would be
affected, and the sun&rsquo;s brightness fade, and the winds would sigh
humanely, and the clouds rain tears, and the woods shed their leaves and put on
mourning in midsummer, if any man should ever for a just cause grieve. Shall I
not have intelligence with the earth? Am I not partly leaves and vegetable
mould myself?
</p>

<p>
What is the pill which will keep us well, serene, contented? Not my or thy
great-grandfather&rsquo;s, but our great-grandmother Nature&rsquo;s universal,
vegetable, botanic medicines, by which she has kept herself young always,
outlived so many old Parrs in her day, and fed her health with their decaying
fatness. For my panacea, instead of one of those quack vials of a mixture
dipped from Acheron and the Dead Sea, which come out of those long shallow
black-schooner looking wagons which we sometimes see made to carry bottles, let
me have a draught of undiluted morning air. Morning air! If men will not drink
of this at the fountain-head of the day, why, then, we must even bottle up some
and sell it in the shops, for the benefit of those who have lost their
subscription ticket to morning time in this world. But remember, it will not
keep quite till noon-day even in the coolest cellar, but drive out the stopples
long ere that and follow westward the steps of Aurora. I am no worshipper of
Hygeia, who was the daughter of that old herb-doctor √Üsculapius, and who is
represented on monuments holding a serpent in one hand, and in the other a cup
out of which the serpent sometimes drinks; but rather of Hebe, cupbearer to
Jupiter, who was the daughter of Juno and wild lettuce, and who had the power
of restoring gods and men to the vigor of youth. She was probably the only
thoroughly sound-conditioned, healthy, and robust young lady that ever walked
the globe, and wherever she came it was spring.

<p>
I think that I love society as much as most, and am ready enough to fasten
myself like a bloodsucker for the time to any full-blooded man that comes in my
way. I am naturally no hermit, but might possibly sit out the sturdiest
frequenter of the bar-room, if my business called me thither.
</p>

<p>
I had three chairs in my house; one for solitude, two for friendship, three for
society. When visitors came in larger and unexpected numbers there was but the
third chair for them all, but they generally economized the room by standing
up. It is surprising how many great men and women a small house will contain. I
have had twenty-five or thirty souls, with their bodies, at once under my roof,
and yet we often parted without being aware that we had come very near to one
another. Many of our houses, both public and private, with their almost
innumerable apartments, their huge halls and their cellars for the storage of
wines and other munitions of peace, appear to me extravagantly large for their
inhabitants. They are so vast and magnificent that the latter seem to be only
vermin which infest them. I am surprised when the herald blows his summons
before some Tremont or Astor or Middlesex House, to see come creeping out over
the piazza for all inhabitants a ridiculous mouse, which soon again slinks into
some hole in the pavement.
</p>

<p>
One inconvenience I sometimes experienced in so small a house, the difficulty
of getting to a sufficient distance from my guest when we began to utter the
big thoughts in big words. You want room for your thoughts to get into sailing
trim and run a course or two before they make their port. The bullet of your
thought must have overcome its lateral and ricochet motion and fallen into its
last and steady course before it reaches the ear of the hearer, else it may
plough out again through the side of his head. Also, our sentences wanted room
to unfold and form their columns in the interval. Individuals, like nations,
must have suitable broad and natural boundaries, even a considerable neutral
ground, between them. I have found it a singular luxury to talk across the pond
to a companion on the opposite side. In my house we were so near that we could
not begin to hear,&mdash;we could not speak low enough to be heard; as when you
throw two stones into calm water so near that they break each other&rsquo;s
undulations. If we are merely loquacious and loud talkers, then we can afford
to stand very near together, cheek by jowl, and feel each other&rsquo;s breath;
but if we speak reservedly and thoughtfully, we want to be farther apart, that
all animal heat and moisture may have a chance to evaporate. If we would enjoy
the most intimate society with that in each of us which is without, or above,
being spoken to, we must not only be silent, but commonly so far apart bodily
that we cannot possibly hear each other&rsquo;s voice in any case. Referred to
this standard, speech is for the convenience of those who are hard of hearing;
but there are many fine things which we cannot say if we have to shout. As the
conversation began to assume a loftier and grander tone, we gradually shoved
our chairs farther apart till they touched the wall in opposite corners, and
then commonly there was not room enough.
</p>

<p>
My &ldquo;best&rdquo; room, however, my withdrawing room, always ready for
company, on whose carpet the sun rarely fell, was the pine wood behind my
house. Thither in summer days, when distinguished guests came, I took them, and
a priceless domestic swept the floor and dusted the furniture and kept the
things in order.
</p>

<p>
If one guest came he sometimes partook of my frugal meal, and it was no
interruption to conversation to be stirring a hasty-pudding, or watching the
rising and maturing of a loaf of bread in the ashes, in the mean while. But if
twenty came and sat in my house there was nothing said about dinner, though
there might be bread enough for two, more than if eating were a forsaken habit;
but we naturally practised abstinence; and this was never felt to be an offence
against hospitality, but the most proper and considerate course. The waste and
decay of physical life, which so often needs repair, seemed miraculously
retarded in such a case, and the vital vigor stood its ground. I could
entertain thus a thousand as well as twenty; and if any ever went away
disappointed or hungry from my house when they found me at home, they may
depend upon it that I sympathized with them at least. So easy is it, though
many housekeepers doubt it, to establish new and better customs in the place of
the old. You need not rest your reputation on the dinners you give. For my own
part, I was never so effectually deterred from frequenting a man&rsquo;s house,
by any kind of Cerberus whatever, as by the parade one made about dining me,
which I took to be a very polite and roundabout hint never to trouble him so
again. I think I shall never revisit those scenes. I should be proud to have
for the motto of my cabin those lines of Spenser which one of my visitors
inscribed on a yellow walnut leaf for a card:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Arriv√©d there, the little house they fill,<br />
    Ne looke for entertainment where none was;<br />
Rest is their feast, and all things at their will:<br />
    The noblest mind the best contentment has.&rdquo;<br />

When Winslow, afterward governor of the Plymouth Colony, went with a companion
on a visit of ceremony to Massasoit on foot through the woods, and arrived
tired and hungry at his lodge, they were well received by the king, but nothing
was said about eating that day. When the night arrived, to quote their own
words,&mdash;&ldquo;He laid us on the bed with himself and his wife, they at the
one end and we at the other, it being only planks laid a foot from the ground,
and a thin mat upon them. Two more of his chief men, for want of room, pressed
by and upon us; so that we were worse weary of our lodging than of our
journey.&rdquo; At one o&rsquo;clock the next day Massasoit &ldquo;brought two
fishes that he had shot,&rdquo; about thrice as big as a bream; &ldquo;these
being boiled, there were at least forty looked for a share in them. The most
ate of them. This meal only we had in two nights and a day; and had not one of
us bought a partridge, we had taken our journey fasting.&rdquo; Fearing that
they would be light-headed for want of food and also sleep, owing to &ldquo;the
savages&rsquo; barbarous singing, (for they used to sing themselves
asleep,)&rdquo; and that they might get home while they had strength to travel,
they departed. As for lodging, it is true they were but poorly entertained,
though what they found an inconvenience was no doubt intended for an honor; but
as far as eating was concerned, I do not see how the Indians could have done
better. They had nothing to eat themselves, and they were wiser than to think
that apologies could supply the place of food to their guests; so they drew
their belts tighter and said nothing about it. Another time when Winslow
visited them, it being a season of plenty with them, there was no deficiency in
this respect.
</p>

<p>
As for men, they will hardly fail one any where. I had more visitors while I
lived in the woods than at any other period in my life; I mean that I had some.
I met several there under more favorable circumstances than I could any where
else. But fewer came to see me on trivial business. In this respect, my company
was winnowed by my mere distance from town. I had withdrawn so far within the
great ocean of solitude, into which the rivers of society empty, that for the
most part, so far as my needs were concerned, only the finest sediment was
deposited around me. Beside, there were wafted to me evidences of unexplored
and uncultivated continents on the other side.

Who should come to my lodge this morning but a true Homeric or Paphlagonian
man,&mdash;he had so suitable and poetic a name that I am sorry I cannot print
it here,&mdash;a Canadian, a woodchopper and post-maker, who can hole fifty
posts in a day, who made his last supper on a woodchuck which his dog caught.
He, too, has heard of Homer, and, &ldquo;if it were not for books,&rdquo; would
&ldquo;not know what to do rainy days,&rdquo; though perhaps he has not read
one wholly through for many rainy seasons. Some priest who could pronounce the
Greek itself taught him to read his verse in the testament in his native parish
far away; and now I must translate to him, while he holds the book,
Achilles&rsquo; reproof to Patroclus for his sad countenance.&mdash;&ldquo;Why
are you in tears, Patroclus, like a young girl?&rdquo;&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Or have you alone heard some news from Phthia?<br />
They say that Men≈ìtius lives yet, son of Actor,<br />
And Peleus lives, son of √Üacus, among the Myrmidons,<br />
Either of whom having died, we should greatly grieve.&rdquo;

</p> <p>
He says, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s good.&rdquo; He has a great bundle of white-oak
bark under his arm for a sick man, gathered this Sunday morning. &ldquo;I
suppose there&rsquo;s no harm in going after such a thing to-day,&rdquo; says
he. To him Homer was a great writer, though what his writing was about he did
not know. A more simple and natural man it would be hard to find. Vice and
disease, which cast such a sombre moral hue over the world, seemed to have
hardly any existence for him. He was about twenty-eight years old, and had left
Canada and his father&rsquo;s house a dozen years before to work in the States,
and earn money to buy a farm with at last, perhaps in his native country. He
was cast in the coarsest mould; a stout but sluggish body, yet gracefully
carried, with a thick sunburnt neck, dark bushy hair, and dull sleepy blue
eyes, which were occasionally lit up with expression. He wore a flat gray cloth
cap, a dingy wool-colored greatcoat, and cowhide boots. He was a great consumer
of meat, usually carrying his dinner to his work a couple of miles past my
house,&mdash;for he chopped all summer,&mdash;in a tin pail; cold meats, often
cold woodchucks, and coffee in a stone bottle which dangled by a string from
his belt; and sometimes he offered me a drink. He came along early, crossing my
bean-field, though without anxiety or haste to get to his work, such as Yankees
exhibit. He wasn&rsquo;t a-going to hurt himself. He didn&rsquo;t care if he
only earned his board. Frequently he would leave his dinner in the bushes, when
his dog had caught a woodchuck by the way, and go back a mile and a half to
dress it and leave it in the cellar of the house where he boarded, after
deliberating first for half an hour whether he could not sink it in the pond
safely till nightfall,&mdash;loving to dwell long upon these themes. He would
say, as he went by in the morning, &ldquo;How thick the pigeons are! If working
every day were not my trade, I could get all the meat I should want by
hunting,&mdash;pigeons, woodchucks, rabbits, partridges,&mdash;by gosh! I could
get all I should want for a week in one day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was a skilful chopper, and indulged in some flourishes and ornaments in his
art. He cut his trees level and close to the ground, that the sprouts which
came up afterward might be more vigorous and a sled might slide over the
stumps; and instead of leaving a whole tree to support his corded wood, he
would pare it away to a slender stake or splinter which you could break off
with your hand at last.
</p>

<p>
He interested me because he was so quiet and solitary and so happy withal; a
well of good humor and contentment which overflowed at his eyes. His mirth was
without alloy. Sometimes I saw him at his work in the woods, felling trees, and
he would greet me with a laugh of inexpressible satisfaction, and a salutation
in Canadian French, though he spoke English as well. When I approached him he
would suspend his work, and with half-suppressed mirth lie along the trunk of a
pine which he had felled, and, peeling off the inner bark, roll it up into a
ball and chew it while he laughed and talked. Such an exuberance of animal
spirits had he that he sometimes tumbled down and rolled on the ground with
laughter at any thing which made him think and tickled him. Looking round upon
the trees he would exclaim,&mdash;&ldquo;By George! I can enjoy myself well
enough here chopping; I want no better sport.&rdquo; Sometimes, when at
leisure, he amused himself all day in the woods with a pocket pistol, firing
salutes to himself at regular intervals as he walked. In the winter he had a
fire by whic
